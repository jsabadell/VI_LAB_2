The investigators will develop a model that comprehensively predicts the population of dwarf galaxies surrounding the Milky Way as a function of dark matter properties and early universe dynamics. Comparing these predictions to the data will yield constraints on dark matter particle models and cosmic inflation. The key product of this work is an efficient and accurate model for the Milky Way’s dwarf galaxy population in non-standard cosmologies. This work will train early career researchers in broadly-applicable computational methods and support undergraduates from underrepresented groups in physics through the National Society of Black Physicists and Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science programs. 

Dwarf galaxies occupy the smallest dark matter halos that can form stars. These systems are extremely sensitive to unknown dark matter and early universe physics. To date, the faintest dwarf galaxies have exclusively been detected as satellites of the Milky Way. This situation presents a theoretical challenge: to discover fundamental physics in these data, we must model the specific formation history of our Galaxy’s dark matter halo and satellite population. The investigators will perform new suites of cosmological simulations constrained to match the Milky Way, with initial conditions appropriate for a variety of dark matter and early-universe scenarios, which will be used to calibrate the Galacticus galaxy formation model. The calibrated model, Galacticus-MW, will rapidly and accurately predict the Milky Way satellite population as a function of the beyond-CDM linear matter power spectrum. Comparing these predictions to the data will yield the first near-field measurement of small-scale matter clustering, along with constraints on dark matter properties (including its particle mass, interactions, and production mechanism) and on cosmic inflation. This work will enable cosmological inference using dwarf galaxy populations detected by Stage IV surveys over the next decade.

The Atlantic Ocean began to form in the Early Jurassic (~190 million years ago) as the Pangaea supercontinent rifted. This project seeks to understand how the central Atlantic Ocean first formed. Geologic data of this time suggest an anomalous geology at the time of initial seafloor spreading, but for reasons that are poorly understood. New marine seismic data will address the first ~50 million years of seafloor spreading in the western Atlantic, next to Eastern North America. The new seismic data will reveal the evolution of oceanic crust and mantle as the Atlantic formed. Participation by students and early-career scientists will give them first-hand experience in marine geophysics.

Formation of ocean basins is fundamental to plate tectonics, yet initial seafloor spreading processes remain enigmatic. The asthenosphere during incipient spreading is likely anomalous in its composition, temperature, and flow patterns compared to mature seafloor spreading. The timescales of thermal and chemical depletion of the mantle and establishment of normal seafloor accretion have not been resolved. This project will shed light on these processes by conducting a novel 2D/3D seismic experiment adjacent to the Eastern North American Margin, spanning the first ~50 Myr of seafloor spreading. The seismic survey will collect four profiles along which both multichannel seismic and ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) data will be acquired. Three shorter profiles will run parallel to paleo-spreading direction, and one long profile will be perpendicular to the shorter profiles.  The new data will constrain the evolution of oceanic crustal thickness, composition, and basement roughness. In addition, OBS recordings of 3D active-source mantle refractions and ambient noise surface waves will be analyzed to infer the orientation and magnitude of asthenospheric anisotropy. Seismic observations will be synthesized with petrological models of mantle melting and oceanic crust crystallization to study the chemical composition and potential temperature of the mantle source regime and how it evolved over time during early seafloor spreading. This experiment will bridge a critical gap between existing seismic datasets across the rifted margin and on mature Atlantic oceanic lithosphere.

But in reality, the specific model that is deployed is just one option of many: previous work has shown that multiplicity – the existence of multiple equally good models – arises at many stages of the machine learning pipeline. Formally reasoning about multiplicity is challenging due to the large (potentially infinite) set of models one has to take into account. As such, existing techniques are currently only able to reason about certain forms of model-based multiplicity, and generally only with empirical guarantees. This project’s novelties are a set of approaches that increase the auditability of machine learning pipelines. These techniques consist of frameworks and formal techniques to understand how multiplicity in the dataset creation and modeling processes impacts the final learned model that is deployed.  The project’s impacts are especially prominent in domains where the decisions of machine learned models directly affect humans --- understanding multiplicity is vital for developing machine learning models that are fair and robust. The investigators are involved with organizing outreach programs to expose high schoolers and undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds to computer science and topics in machine learning.

This project investigates multiplicity for diverse model architectures across the whole machine learning pipeline including training data, model predictions, and model explanations. The research integrates formal methods and robust machine learning techniques to provide techniques to help answer the question of whether machine learning outcomes are reliable, or whether they are just an artifact of multiplicity. For instance, the investigators study algorithms to certify (deterministically or probabilistically, depending on the model architecture) whether a model’s prediction is robust under various sources of multiplicity.

Compaction is the most common method of soil improvement for these soils. Yet, traditional compaction often relies heavily on engineering experience and post-construction quality control, leading to under or over-compaction problems in the field. This research project will provide new insights into the effects of granular soil properties and compaction equipment characteristics on compaction efficiency, which may lead to more efficient construction practices and reduced carbon footprints of civil infrastructure systems. This project is a collaborative effort between two Penn State campuses, Altoona, primarily an undergraduate institution, and University Park, a research institution. It will provide substantive research experiences to undergraduate students from Altoona, exposing them to contemporary knowledge such as sensing technology and data transmission. These experiences will enrich the engineering curricula at both campuses. In particular, the improved curriculum will benefit the Rail Transportation Engineering program at Penn State – Altoona, the nation’s first and only four-year bachelor’s degree program in railroad transportation.

The central hypothesis of this research is that particle kinematics can be used as a proxy of soil compaction, rather than surface settlement, to study the state of compaction in granular soils. This hypothesis will be tested through an integrated experimental and numerical investigation. The project will involve laboratory compaction tests, which will be instrumented with geophones, accelerometers, a linear variable differential transducer, and a load cell; these instruments will record the dynamic response of soil in the compaction zone and the reaction force to the compactor due to soil-compactor interaction. In particular, wireless sensing devices, SmartRocks, will be embedded at various locations in the compaction zone to record the evolution of particle kinematics (e.g., acceleration and rotation) during compaction. The compaction test results will be used to calibrate and validate a computing model based on the idea of fusing SmartRock measurements and discrete element simulations to increase the accuracy of the simulations. The validated computing model will be used to extend the insights gained from the laboratory tests to field conditions that resemble the compaction of a moving vibratory roller compactor. This research will, for the first time, yield insights into the effect of granular soil properties, equipment characteristics, and operating frequency on the particle kinematic behavior (e.g., rotation, acceleration, and contact stress) in different zones during compaction.

Research shows that a significant percentage of autistic youth have negative interactions with police, leading to fears among autistic individuals and their caregivers. Current de-escalation protocols based on behavioral science are effective but not widely accessible or integrated into first responder training. This project aims to address these gaps by developing a coordinated, IoT-enabled generative AI platform that enhances real-time response to emergency behavioral events (EBEs) involving autistic individuals. The broader significance of this project lies in its potential to transform emergency response systems by providing first responders with the tools and knowledge needed to handle EBEs effectively. The outcome will improve safety and well-being for autistic individuals and their families in challenging scenarios that may require first responder engagement.

The project will conduct a feasibility and pilot study to develop a smart, connected community for coordinated EBE response using IoT and generative AI technologies. The research will involve collaboration with community stakeholders, including autistic individuals, caregivers, emergency responders, and community initiatives, to identify current gaps and test trustworthy solutions.  The project will detail the data needed for effective EBE response, current solutions used by stakeholders, barriers to integration, and the potential of AI and IoT technologies in enhancing response efforts. Three main research aims are being pursued:
1.	Social Science Study: Identify gaps in current de-escalation approaches and barriers to coordinated response through community-based participatory research (CBPR) involving surveys and focus groups.
2.	Identification of IoT and AI Solutions: Survey and evaluate AI models and IoT technologies that support personalized de-escalation strategies and seamless data sharing among first responders.
3.	Pilot Study: Test the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed IoT-AI platform in a controlled setting, gathering feedback from participants to refine the system for real-world application.

Preliminary work by the team has demonstrated the effectiveness of augmented reality for training first responders and highlighted the need for integrated, real-time support during EBEs. This project builds on these findings to develop a comprehensive solution that addresses the unique needs of autistic individuals and enhances community safety through advanced technology and stakeholder collaboration.

It provides essential information and invaluable insights into population dynamics, health, risks, and vulnerability, all of which help shape conservation policies, management decisions and strategies. Traditional tracking methods face significant challenges in balancing cost and precision. They either require attaching transmitters to animals that communicate with radio receivers or satellites (high accuracy but expensive and invasive) or rely on manually produced sketches from photos of distinctive features such as scars (low accuracy and labor-intensive). The overarching goal of this project is to optimize this cost-precision trade-off by designing and delivering an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven system for individual photo-identification and tracking in conservation studies of Florida manatees, a threatened species. The system aims to streamline the creation, maintenance, query, and behavior analysis of manatees using photo-identification. This project will train several graduate students, and will advance collaboration between AI researchers and conservation scientists.   

In order to bring transformative advancements to current conservation capabilities, emphasizing cost-effective, evidence-based conservation planning, the project will 1) develop new algorithms grounded in explainable AI to identify and track individual manatees by their distinctive features, such as scars and markers, which serve as interpretable evidence for tracking; 2) support long-range spatio-temporal tracking by representing each animal as a series of sketch images throughout their lifespan, annotated with timestamps, geographic information, and metadata on life encounters; and 3) craft a framework for region-based conservation resource planning and management that models evolving patterns in local regions, including both natural and human-caused disturbances, to assess how local animal populations react to these regional changes. The collaborative research team will also extend approaches to additional threatened or endangered marine species (sea turtles, whales, rays). This project will have a lasting impact on the research community and education sectors by highlighting critical needs and showcasing viable design ideas in both conservation and computer science, and in their nexus.

Unlike conventional side-channel vulnerabilities, the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel emission leaks information over wireless channel, offering a unique medium to investigate IoT security without accessing or instrumenting the device. Unfortunately, current research on the EM side-channel attacks of IoT devices has been severely limited by the lack of a practical sensing system that can extract weak EM signals emitted by computer processors or memories, separate those EM signals of co-located devices, and robustly unravel their semantics. To tackle these challenges, this project will design, implement, and evaluate a practical EM sensing system named EMRadar to enable research on EM side-channel attacks and defenses in real environments. The results of this project will deepen our understanding of EM side-channel attacks and inform emission security standards. Practical EM side-channel defenses enabled by this project will transform various security-critical IoT applications, including detecting program deviations in medical devices that are highly resource-constrained, such as the implantable cardiac devices and the smart insulin pumps. The project is dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusion in STEM by blending research with education and outreach activities. The PI will actively involve local high school students by providing hands-on activities and presentations elucidating fundamental concepts of IoT technologies and cybersecurity. To bridge the gap in STEM participation, the project will engage students from underrepresented minority groups in Detroit and Pontiac as well as various Michigan-based organizations for girls. This endeavor is supported by collaborations with the Oakland University's STEM summer camps and field trips, as well as the Michigan Aspirations in Computing Committee. Through these initiatives, the project will inspire a broad spectrum of students to pursue futures in engineering and science.

This project will design, implement, and evaluate the EMRadar, a practical EM sensing system that enables research on EM side-channel attacks and defenses in realistic environments. The proposed research will build on a three-layer architecture model. (1) In the sensing layer, EMRadar will incorporate innovative signal processing techniques to extract weak EM signals that are deeply buried in noise and contaminated by interference. To achieve this, the EMRadar will exploit the unique characteristics of EM emissions from a processor or memory and IoT software behavior, enabling novel methods that can adapt and optimize signal processing techniques used in classic Radar systems for highly sensitive EM sensing. (2) In the representation layer, this project will explore universal representation and classification of EM signals to unravel EM side-channel emissions of processors and memories. Despite extensive studies on EM side-channel emissions, accurate explanation of the semantics of EM side-channel signals remains highly challenging due to significant variation of EM signal pattern and the EM interference produced by workloads running on the same device. This project will leverage the recent advances in time series analysis and machine learning to revisit the representation of EM signals, and conduct a systematic measurement study to understand the robustness of universal representation across IoT devices with different architectures. (3) In the application layer, the EMRadar will be evaluated in real-world setups and applications. The PI will collaborate with domain experts to explore applications of the system developed in this project, such as supporting efficient IoT-based applications in healthcare, automobile industry, and intelligent buildings.

Algebraic combinatorics, as a mathematical discipline, is a tool to represent abstract mathematics in a more concrete way--similar to how a bar graph or scatter plot is a tool to represent a long list of numbers in a more intuitive way. In the case of the amplituhedron, combinatorics provides a way to break the amplituhedron up into smaller, simpler pieces. It also provides a way to visualize each piece, even though the pieces do not fit in three dimensions. It is through this combinatorics that the conjectural relationship between the amplituhedron and particle scattering is most apparent. In one project the PI will work to prove this conjectural relationship with collaborators Even-Zohar, Lakrec, Parisi, Tessler, and Williams. In general, the PI will seek to better understand the combinatorics of amplituhedra and related mathematical objects called cluster varieties. The PI will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in thisd research.

The broader mathematical context for the proposed projects is the theory of total positivity. Classically, a matrix is totally positive if all minors are positive. Lusztig extended the notion of total positivity to partial flag varieties, while Postnikov independently defined the positive Grassmannian. The combinatorics of total positivity is incredibly rich, leading to the definition of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky. The PI proposes to study two generalizations of total positivity through a combinatorial lens. The first project concerns amplituhedra, which generalize the positive Grassmannian and arise in particle physics. The PI will work to resolve conjectures on the relationship between tilings of m=4 amplituhedra and the computation of scattering amplitudes, as well as various conjectures on tilings of m=2 amplituhedra. The second project concerns cluster structures on braid varieties, which generalize positive partial flag varieties. The PI will further develop the combinatorics of this cluster structure, investigating 3D plabic graphs and their relationship to weaves, and explore applications.

Clots, while aiding in stopping bleeding, can also obstruct blood flow in vessels, leading to cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, understanding clot formation and its response in the live blood environment is crucial for predicting and treating clot growth. However, predicting clot growth and rupture is challenging, as blood flow impacts the formation and composition of a clot, which in-return determines the strength of the clot and its response to flow. On the other hand, the growth and composition of the clot changes the flow as well. This award will support research striving to develop multiscale modeling tools that use powerful computers and artificial intelligence to better predict clot growth and its response to pulsatile flows, collision from blood cells, and vessel dilation. Experimental validations will be performed using 3D printed silicon based vascular network replica.  In addition, the project will integrate research and education by developing curriculum, employing innovative teaching tools like interactive notebooks to train the next generation or engineers and scientists, with a focus on underrepresented minorities, in computational thinking, high-performance computing, and machine learning. Outreach activities involve participation in STEM festivals and organizing engineering summer camps to inspire K12 students to enter the STEM field.  

The overall objective of this CAREER project is to develop a multiscale model to predict clot growth and response, under different flow conditions. Specifically, it will: 1) identify and investigate the impact of key dimensionless parameters on clot growth and structure considering flow, red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and other biopolymers such as fibrin and von Willebrand factor; 2) characterize clot response including deformation and rupture due to pulsatile flow and vessel wall deformation with given composition; and 3) predict clot growth, rupture, and quantify its uncertainties in large scale vascular network using physics informed neural network (or PINN) augmented one-dimensional models. This project is a critical step toward understanding clot mechanics and providing support for clinical decision-making for surgery and treatment. This project will allow the Principal Investigator to advance the knowledge base in computational science and engineering and establish a long-term career in Biomechanics and Mechanobiology.

However, their persistence in the environment poses a significant threat to the drinking water supply of roughly one in three people in the U.S. One promising method for PFAS removal from contaminated water is nanofiltration (NF), a technique that removes nanoscale particles from a liquid using membranes as a filter. Yet, several critical challenges must be addressed to make NF a viable part of PFAS cleanup efforts. First, the effectiveness of NF in removing the wide variety of PFAS types, especially (ultra)short-chain PFASs and those found in complex mixtures, remains unknown. Second, a better understanding of how various forms of PFAS interact with NF membranes at a molecular level is needed. Third, the lack of predictive models to identify key factors that affect PFAS passage through NF membranes hinders rational membrane design and selection. This research aims to address these knowledge gaps by combining experiments and computer simulations, integrated with specialized modeling techniques such as machine learning, to investigate how NF removes PFAS from contaminated water resources. The fundamental knowledge gained through this work will advance membrane-based technologies for remediating PFAS-contaminated water. In addition, this project will include public engagement and educational activities such as developing a new educational module, training students from underserved groups, and hosting outreach activities for PreK-12 students to increase PFAS scientific literacy and awareness.

The overarching goal of this research is to use an innovative integration of experimental and computational studies to elucidate the performance and mechanisms of (ultra)short-chain PFAS removal by NF. To achieve this goal, the NF removal performance for (ultra)short-chain PFAS of varied structural features will be evaluated, and the structure-property-performance relationship of PFAS removal in NF treatment will be established using machine learning techniques. The investigators will use non-targeted chemical analyses to further assess the NF performance in removing diverse PFAS from complex aqueous film-forming foam-impacted water. The interactions and transport of PFAS at the water-membrane interface and within polyamide NF membranes will be probed theoretically using molecular dynamics simulations to gain mechanistic insights into the experimental results. The findings of this research will generate fundamental knowledge to inform rational design strategies for developing more effective NF membranes tailored to remediating PFAS-contaminated water.

To date, is has been difficult to predict how the addition of new microbial species into a community impacts microbiome function, and as such, it has been difficult to design microbiomes with desired functions. The prediction of microbiome functions from the genotypes of constituent species remains a longstanding, unsolved problem in microbiome science and engineering. The long-term goal of this project is to develop and apply an integrated experimental and computational approach to uncover the design principles at the molecular and cellular level that govern microbiome function.  These models would be able to then be used in a variety of applications to solve problems related to climate resilience, human health, and the bioeconomy. In addition, the investigators will increase the inclusion and public participation in STEM by partnering with a well-established informal science education program at the Morgridge Institute for Research, serving thousands of youths per year.  

This project will integrate advanced machine learning techniques with high-throughput microbial community construction and metabolomics in order to elucidate design principles of molecular networks involving any cellular process (e.g. metabolism, stress, signaling) that govern microbiome functions. Notably, the proposed framework will enable the prediction of new and uncharacterized species on microbiome functions, which has not been previously demonstrated using a data-driven model. The investigators will apply this multi-scale modeling framework to study the effects of diverse bacteria on community composition and anaerobic metabolic states. While this proposal focuses on the genotype-function mapping of microbial communities, the data-driven framework will provide a foundation for the prediction of microbiome functions from omics data including transcriptional profiling data, proteomics and beyond. The novel systems biology framework could be applied more broadly to any microbiome or microbiome function. Deciphering the molecular-level design principles of microbiomes would provide a deeper insight into the organizational principles of these energetically efficient and resilient systems.

Such an assumption is often violated in practice, due to e.g., adversarial perturbations, modeling error between simulator and real-world applications, non-stationary environment, and limited amount of training data. The discrepancy between the training and test environments gives rise to a model mismatch, which lead to a notable decline in performance and restrict the suitability of RL in crucial domains, e.g., healthcare, critical infrastructure, transportation systems, and smart cities. To address the above challenge, there have been noteworthy efforts to develop distributionally robust RL approaches. This CAREER project aims to advance the fundamental algorithmic and theoretic limits of distributionally robust RL. The research outcome of this project holds the promise to push the algorithmic and theoretical boundaries of robust RL, and will deliver provably convergent, efficient and minimax optimal robust RL algorithms. The project will have a significant impact on theory and practice of sequential decision making in various domains, e.g., special education, intelligent transportation system, wireless communication networks, power systems and drone networks. The activities in this project will provide concrete principles and design guidelines to achieve robustness in face of model uncertainty.

The research efforts are organized around three complimentary thrusts: (i) Thrust A focuses on developing theoretical and algorithmic foundations for distributionally robust RL under the long-term average-reward criterion.  (ii) Thrust B focuses on developing a unified framework of distributional robustness for learning (robust) policies from offline dataset without active data acquisition and exploration, and further uncovering their fundamental limits; (iii) Thrust C focuses on constructive approaches and fundamental limits of robust RL under constraints, i.e., optimizing reward while simultaneously guaranteeing constraints under model uncertainty. This project will develop fundamental understandings of robust RL, minimax optimal robust RL algorithms and novel technical convergence and complexity analyses. The research outcome will significantly improve the robustness of RL algorithms and will be of interest to a broad range of communities, e.g., machine learning, statistics, information theory, networking, communication, power, and education.

Separation technologies that can purify saline or contaminated water and recover valuable components are urgently needed. Separation using nanofiltration (NF) has been widely used for water purification and desalination, but emerging challenges such as the extraction of lithium from brines to satisfy the booming lithium-ion battery market go beyond the capabilities of current NF membrane technology. Thus, the overarching goal of this collaborative project is to explore a novel mechanism known as ion dehydration that can be applied using modified NF membranes to carry out challenging separations. This project leverages expertise in computational simulation, laboratory experimentation, and NF membrane fabrication in an international collaboration with researchers at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Successful completion of this project will advance our understanding of NF separation to address pressing societal needs. Beyond the technical focus, the project will benefit society by educating the public through outreach activities to increase scientific literacy and awareness of water and resource sustainability.

NF membranes have been used for water purification and desalination processes for many years. Recently, there has been increasing demand for high membrane selectivity between solutes to enable energy-efficient separation for water purification and resource recovery. However, achieving precise separation between similarly sized and charged ions using current polyamide NF membranes remains a significant challenge. Addressing this challenge requires leveraging mechanisms beyond those prevailing in current water-solute separation.  Accordingly, the project will pursue three primary thrusts to regulate the transport and selectivity of monovalent ions in polyamide NF membranes: 1) investigate the role of ion dehydration on the transport and selectivity of ions in state-of-the-art NF membranes; 2) delineate the effect of membrane surface hydrophobicity and charge on ion dehydration using self-fabricated membranes with tunable surface properties; and 3) use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to support the results of ion dehydration and membrane selectivity experiments. Thrust 1 will utilize a custom-made diffusion cell to probe the ion-ion selectivity for a series of ions with distinct hydration properties at different temperatures, pressures, and solvent types. Thrust 2 will focus on fabrication of thin-film composite polyamide (TFC-PA) NF membranes with systematically altered surface hydrophobicity and surface charge. Thrust 3 will apply MD simulations of water and solute ion transport through a TFC-PA NF membrane, which can be used to understand the relationship between the membrane structure and ion transport/rejection. Beyond the direct technical thrusts, the project will include outreach and educational activities that broaden its impacts by providing research training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups. The team will also perform outreach activities for K-12 students from local communities of Colorado and Wisconsin to increase scientific literacy and support the Nation’s STEM workforce.

Workforce diversity is crucial in today's rapidly changing world. Autistic adults, with their unique perspectives and skills, can significantly contribute to workplace diversity. However, compared to similarly qualified peers, they often struggle to find and retain jobs, including in STEM fields where the U.S. faces an increasing skills gap. Autistic adults comprise at least 2% of the U.S. population, so increasing their employment rate could meaningfully expand and enhance the U.S. manufacturing and STEM workforce. This project aims to address this issue by developing smart industrial robots that provide personalized support for autistic employees in manufacturing and STEM work environments. By creating more supportive and inclusive workplaces, we seek to improve job retention, income, and independence for autistic employees. Furthermore, this initiative will help bridge the skills gap in manufacturing and boost economic growth. The advancements from this project will also enhance educational opportunities and improve employment prospects for autistic adults, fostering more neurodiverse and productive work environments that drive innovation in the U.S. manufacturing sector.

This project focuses on developing smart industrial robots that offer personalized support for autistic employees in STEM and manufacturing jobs. Our approach combines the co-design framework of mutual shaping with the principles of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We will engage key stakeholders, including autistic adults and industry experts, throughout all development cycles in an iterative design process to advance industrial robot intelligence.
The primary objectives of this project are twofold: (1) to co-create support approaches based on SDT that address fundamental psychological needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) through interviews, focus groups, and human-in-the-loop simulations, and (2) to enhance robot intelligence for accurately identifying and meeting workers' psychological needs in manufacturing settings, resulting in adaptive and personalized support. By integrating SDT-based support into industrial robot design, we anticipate increased motivation, work quality, and job satisfaction for all employees. This neuro-affirming work environment will, in turn, promote inclusion, productivity, and innovation in the STEM workforce.

For example, in nature, this mode of locomotion is employed by water-walking insects for speedy movement in emergency situations and by certain bacterial swarms for rapid interfacial migration toward nutrient-rich regions for further colonization. In recent years, Marangoni surfers of various sizes have been engineered to perform a wide array of tasks, including environmental sensing and monitoring, microfluidic manipulation, and interfacial self-assembly. The goal of this project is to investigate the motion of Marangoni surfers at spherical interfaces, which are difficult to generate on Earth but achievable in zero gravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The propulsion of these interfacial surfers will be studied, with a specific focus on the importance of both the global interfacial curvature of the spherical water droplet and the local interface curvature around the surfers. Additionally, this project will have broader societal impacts through its integrated educational initiatives, which include outreach to underrepresented middle and high school students, research mentorship of community college and graduate students, and curriculum development.

The principal objective of this project is to investigate the individual and collective hydrodynamics of Marangoni surfers that self-propel on spherical interfaces. This research aims to generate new knowledge by establishing a computational-experimental framework that includes both ISS- and ground-based measurements. The framework is designed to capture the complex interactions between the motion of active particles, the transport of released species, and the effects of interface curvature and confinement. Notably, performing experiments on a levitating spherical drop in microgravity allows us to probe the importance of interface curvature on particle motion and assembly while simultaneously eliminating the local gravitationally-induced interface curvature effects from around the active particle that have been shown to play an oversized role in inter-particle interactions. The insights gained from this project are expected to define the foundational principles for designing self-propelled surfers optimized for curved interfaces, potentially leading to transformative advancements in robotics and microfluidics. Also, the results of this research will enhance our understanding of self-assembly processes, facilitating the rapid production of small-scale structured materials. Moreover, this study will shed light on the role of Marangoni stresses in the colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria at fluidic interfaces, offering new strategies for tackling infectious diseases by elucidating bacterial colonization and survival mechanisms in adverse conditions.

Climate change is threatening water sustainability by causing more droughts and limiting water access to people around the world. For example, the Western United States has suffered from severe droughts and heat waves, and the Colorado River has recently experienced record low water levels. Brackish water desalination (BWD) is a promising approach to produce more freshwater, but it is inhibited by the lack of effective strategies for brine management. The goal of this research is to develop cost- and energy-efficient brine treatment technologies that enable decarbonized BWD for climate-adaptive water supply. This goal is targeted to be achieved through interdisciplinary research that integrates fundamental interfacial processes and thermal transport to achieve a solar driven zero liquid discharge (ZLD) system. The environmental impacts of this system will be evaluated by techno-economic analysis, life-cycle assessment, and assessing public acceptance. Further benefits to society will result from research training of college students from underrepresented groups, curriculum enrichment, and outreach and public engagement activities.

The accelerating global effects of climate change have resulted in an immediate need of adapting water supplies to the rapidly intensified drought conditions. The nationwide adoption of BWD as a feasible strategy to augment freshwater supply is hindered by the challenge of brine management. Minimizing brine volume via ZLD is the key to render BWD a practical and viable means to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change on water security and resiliency. The overarching goal of this project is to achieve solar driven ZLD for decarbonized inland freshwater production as part of a strategy to address climate change. Specific objectives of the project are to 1) develop a novel process integrating nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to enable cost-effective brine volume reduction; 2) design an innovative interface enhanced crystallizer for energy-efficient and robust brine crystallization, guided by fundamental understanding of interfacial salt crystallization, 3) develop a novel high-efficiency heat pump to power ZLD with interface enhanced crystallizer; and 4) evaluate the sustainability of off-grid, decarbonized inland BWD with ZLD with concurrent techno-economic, lifecycle, carbon flow, and social acceptance assessments. To achieve these objectives, this project will integrate and converge knowledge and approaches from multiple disciplines including environmental engineering, environmental sustainability, interfacial engineering, thermal transport processes, systems engineering, and social science. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through enabling decarbonized ZLD to support the wide adoption of climate-resilient inland desalination that improves water resilience against a changing climate. The project will provide undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups with opportunities of preforming interdisciplinary, convergent research to solve an environmental and sustainability challenge of global concern.

Data integration methods such as record linkage are critically important in generating actionable insights from the combination of data sources in a cost-effective manner. Record linkage merges multiple files by identifying matching records associated with the same entity. Without unique identifiers, this process is often error-prone, bearing the risk of false and missed links, which can compromise data analysis based on the merged file. Building on established implementations of record linkage, this project develops software in popular data science programming languages that addresses potential errors and uncertainty in data analysis performed post-linkage. The development of the software is driven by the needs of federal statistical agencies, researchers and practitioners in health services, and other stakeholders seeking to harness record linkage to unravel the potential of their data. The resulting additional capabilities for linked data analysis support informed decision-making in public administration and health services and enable savings in data collection and human labor. The project provides research opportunities and support for graduate students and delivers educational materials on the record linkage and analysis pipeline, thereby contributing to workforce development and the training of future data scientists.

Existing software for record linkage is almost entirely dedicated to aspects pertaining to the creation of linked files, leaving a gap in supporting downstream tasks. This project fills this gap by providing software supporting post-linkage data analysis, an evolving subject with various open problems requiring novel statistical and computational tools. Guided by use cases from several application domains, the investigators intend to unify and refine state-of-the-art approaches to post-linkage data analysis in primary and secondary analysis settings given information of varying degrees about the underlying linkage process. The project develops scalable, robust and user-friendly implementations of these approaches embedded in a modular software that is envisioned to ease burdens for users of linked data, enable the validity of analyses based on such data, and propel advances in the field of data integration. The latter is achieved by generating capabilities for validation, benchmarking, and inspiring new avenues of methodological research.

While individual extreme events like droughts and heatwaves negatively affect crop yields, the most severe effects result from compound extreme events, posing significant challenges for climate adaptation. Quantifying these extreme climate shocks is of great interest to industries, insurance companies, and governments. This study aims to investigate the interconnected climate extremes of droughts and heatwaves, which can co-evolve over time (temporal compounding) or occur simultaneously in different breadbasket regions (spatial compounding). Although the risks of individual extremes have been studied, an integrated risk assessment of temporal and spatial compounding extremes on global breadbaskets and supply regions is lacking. Spatial compounding events can lead to significant economic impacts on American industries and strain interconnected supply chains. This GOALI project involves a university-industry partnership to investigate the risks of temporal and spatial compounding climate extremes on global breadbasket regions and PepsiCo's supply chain source regions.

The project objective are to: (a) quantify the potential risk of drought, heatwaves, and compound drought and heatwave events on crop yields for breadbasket regions, (b) quantify the spatial compounding risk of extreme events simultaneously occurring over multiple (coupled) breadbasket regions, (c) investigate the potential impact of climate change on the evolution and spatial synchronization of drought, heatwave, and compound events for the breadbasket regions, and (d) develop seasonal prediction models for spatially compounding extreme events and associated risk on crop yields over the supply regions for PepsiCo. The research results will have a positive societal impact by reducing the risk of extreme events on global food security and enhancing the competitiveness of American multinational food industries globally. The collaborative framework will drive innovations and foster new talent, such as graduate students and postdocs, by creating a skilled workforce capable of addressing real-world challenges. Agriculture-related stakeholders, including business units, industries, and farmers who outsource agricultural products, can use the created tools to mitigate the risks of climate extremes, enhance environmental sustainability, promote social equity and economic stability for farmers, and strengthen global cooperation between American industries and international partners.

As a result, many mid-career researchers do not make the impact they set out to achieve, or simply leave academia. Without a structured support system and training, these faculty do not have the skills they need to endure -- let alone flourish -- at this critical point in their careers. Even more importantly, a lack of diversity in senior academic positions limits the community’s ability to build a workforce of future educators and researchers necessary to address local to global challenges of climate change. The absence of structured training leaves professionals in these fields ill-equipped to navigate difficult conversations, power dynamics, and the overwhelming demands of their multifaceted roles. Research suggests that leadership training programs improve leadership effectiveness, project outcomes, research engagement, emotional intelligence and confidence, while also reducing workplace conflict. Even though mid-career faculty comprise the largest segment of academia and that the benefits of mid-career leadership training are resounding, leadership programs are rarely available for them. ClimPraxis will develop a framework for climate and environmental scholars at the mid-career stage to build community and gain critical leadership skills.

The goal of this project is to provide structure and opportunities for mid-career cryosphere scholars to interact and support each other. Through intentional leadership training and goal setting, this project will support new leaders that we believe will administer to a more diverse community and will enable scholars to work together on bigger, multidisciplinary problems that the traditionally siloed structure of academia discourages. This pilot program will include a cohort of climate scientists working in the cryosphere; focusing this effort on a small community with contiguous career goals and substantive, field-specific, leadership challenges will facilitate cross-pollination both within disciplines and between institutions, and generate targeted support and training. This pilot program will focus on career reflection and assessment, leadership skill building, career planning, and career action. By documenting the process and collecting feedback from participants, this pilot will also investigate the individual needs of mid-career researchers and effective ways to meet those needs.

Little is known about how wetlands function, especially in the tropics. With changing climate, it is expected that tropical wetlands, especially seasonal ones, may shift between carbon consumption and release of carbon. Methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, is typically produced under flooded conditions, although some evidence suggests that shifts between wet and dry conditions also lead to its release. Savannas (Cerrado) in Brazil have a range of grassland types including ever-wet peatlands, seasonally wet grasslands, and dry grasslands that are never flooded, with the seasonal wetlands shifting in water levels between dry and wet seasons. It is expected that these ecosystems will become hotter and drier in the future. Brazilian savannas have been understudied and under protected; they are also at risk of conversion for example to agribusiness and urban development. They are the source of the headwaters for river systems such as the Amazon, meaning they are important for providing clean water and other resources to the people and other organisms dependent on them. Understanding Brazilian savanna carbon dynamics now and under future environmental conditions is critical for the region. They can also be used as models to understand tropical savannas around the globe. This proposal makes use of the natural gradient, from ever-wet peatlands to dry grasslands, and seasonal shifts through time to collect data on the amount and frequency of greenhouse gases emitted today and the changing extents of wetlands seasonally. Researchers will use these data to predict how savannas may store and release carbon under future warming and drying climates. As part of this project, student biologists will be trained, including in classes on savanna field ecology and workshops on using field data to predict changes in greenhouse gas release in the future. Biologists and indigenous artists will also collaborate on artwork to demonstrate the importance of savanna systems for and to public audiences. 

This proposal will answer three questions: Q1. What are the drivers of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in carbon storage and flux across saturation gradients? Q2. How do saturation extents (areas and perimeters) in tropical grasslands change over seasonal and decadal scales? Q3. How will rates and forms of carbon emissions from tropical grasslands change under future climates? To test Q1, spatially distributed measurements will be coupled with high-temporal resolution measurements to understand greenhouse gas, soil, and vegetation carbon dynamics across the saturation gradient. Greenhouse gas variability will be measured spatially and temporally with chambers. Site changes through time will be determined by initial soil characterization, combined with seasonal measurements of plant phenology, stomatal conductance, porewater chemistry, environmental and groundwater measures. To test Q2, high resolution remote sensing and field reference data will be combined to map wetland extent seasonally. Carbon and lead isotope dating will be used to understand wetlands extent changes at decadal scales. To test Q3, data from Q1 and Q2 will be utilized in Earth system models. Estimates of carbon sequestration patterns and greenhouse gas emissions will be spatially simulated with projections of carbon balance changes and greenhouse gas with expected shifts in regional climate and hydrology.

Given the financial reward associated with computer science (CS) degrees, increasing diversity in CS majors has important implications for equity within society. One strategy for recruiting a diverse workforce in CS is to build accessible pathways from community colleges to undergraduate CS degree programs. Community college transfer students represent a diverse, high-achieving, and often untapped pool of talented emerging computer scientists. Thus, supporting their success is essential to broadening participation in CS, and future research is needed to understand how community college transfer students navigate their CS degree pathways and obtain success in reaching their educational and professional goals. 


This mixed methods study will rely on longitudinal data in the form of surveys, student records, and ethnographic interviews, beginning from the time transfer students enter their UC campus and following them as they matriculate through their CS degree programs. Specific analyses will be guided by two overarching questions: (1) What trajectories do community college transfer students follow in their computer science bachelor’s degree pursuits? (2) How do community college transfer students following varying degree trajectories describe and make meaning of their experiences? Person-centered statistical analyses and ethnographic interviews will also explore variation by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic background. In particular, this study will add nuance and complexity in terms of how we understand community college transfer student success, pushing us to define success beyond traditional metrics (e.g., degree efficiency; four- or six-year graduation rates; etc.). In doing so, this study will build a more robust knowledge base that can contribute to efforts to advance equity in CS by supporting community college transfer students as they exercise agency throughout their degree programs and obtain their professional goals.

Based on their specific requirements, different algorithms (including machine learning) are needed, such as reachability computation, pathfinding, and state prediction. For example, the graph neural network (GNN) algorithm can help to learn the compact vector representations of the states and transitions to capture the complex patterns and dependencies. However, existing computation architectures for such techniques are not very efficient for two major reasons: (i) the algorithms are not computationally efficient, and (ii) the data size is very large. This research pioneers the development of an accelerated computation architecture for system modeling techniques and applying them to critical smart environment applications. This project will address the growing national need for professionals in accelerated computation architecture, algorithms, and machine learning. The research will produce an accelerated computation architecture that serves as a foundational tool for fellow science and engineering practitioners in academia and industry. Educational initiatives integrate the research findings into graduate and undergraduate curriculum development. Additionally, outreach and educational activities are conducted to promote participation from K-12 and undergraduate students from populations underrepresented in computing. 

The overarching goal of this project is to design an accelerated computation architecture for state modeling techniques and to apply them to important smart environment applications. Towards that, this project includes three synergistic research thrusts. Specifically, Thrust 1 designs efficient computation techniques to accelerate the reachability computation in a state transition representation, which can be used to detect if any undesired (e.g., unsafe) state is reachable. Thrust 2 accelerates the computation of graph machine learning algorithms by adaptively reducing the overhead of instant updates and maintaining high-quality communities.

Increasingly, landscapes are at risk under the growing pressures of land use alteration and climate change. Understanding how landscapes dynamically connect the transfer of water, sediment, and nutrients to rivers and the role humans play in modulating this connectivity is crucial if we are to sustainably manage our shared water resources. Thus, the driving questions behind this work are “how have humans changed the landscapes around us for the worse and how are we able to manage them for the better?” This project will answer these questions and advance the frontiers of research and education for sustainable water management by coupling agricultural, municipal, and stormwater expertise together with high-frequency aquatic sensing, deep learning modeling, and large-sample water quality datasets. This research will generate fundamental scientific advances to identify the magnitude, duration, and extent of landscape loading to river systems across climatological, geomorphic, and anthropogenic settings. The education of today’s students, who will become tomorrow’s stakeholders, is deeply embedded in this project through hands-on experiences that will equip them with the confidence and communication skills to handle big data and tackle society’s grandest water challenges. 

Contemporary research in hydrologic sciences recognizes the importance of connectivity in most aspects of the water cycle; however, despite its ubiquity, connectivity is often assessed either qualitatively or in a static, structural context. The proposed research has the potential to be transformative in moving toward a dynamic assessment of connectivity. This project will quantify dynamic connectivity through time and across space for the United States. This will be achieved by leveraging high-frequency aquatic sensors for nitrate and turbidity from over 150 rivers, which serve as training data for a deep learning model. Further, a mathematical description of dynamic connectivity will inform dominant pathways of connection. Explainable machine learning techniques will link how dynamic landscape attributes lead to riverine water quality impacts. Thereafter, the potential to use dynamic connectivity as a management tool will be assessed through a web application developed for practitioners. The outcomes will lead directly into the education and training of the stakeholders-of-tomorrow, including through building big data confidence in high school settings and science communication skills in college students.

However, their perceptions of stereotypical STEM culture are incongruent with such values and discourages consideration of STEM education/careers. This is commonly referred to as Goal Congruity Theory. Not only does this incongruity discourage consideration of STEM education/careers, it also thwarts efforts to broaden participation of HMM in STEM. In fact, despite the countless resources invested to broaden participation in engineering, women and Hispanic, LatinX/e/a/o, XicanX/e/a/o peoples, inclusive of their intersectionalities (HLX+), represent only 16% and 9% of the college educated engineering workforce, respectively. Although, the efforts have resulted in an increased share of engineering Bachelor’s degrees awarded to women (24%) and HLX+ (14%) over the years, women and HLX+ are still unacceptably underrepresented in the college educated engineering workforce. Considerable research has explored engineering identity development as a potential solution to address many of the issues facing engineering education. However, critiques of the narrow focus of the literature (e.g., identification with the profession itself, historical definitions of the profession) disclose that none ask students to connect their beliefs, values, or other aspects of identity to engineering. Engineering identity may support recruitment and retention efforts, but it is wanting if the central goal is to broaden participation and increase diversity because individuals’ backgrounds (e.g., ethnic, racial, cultural, gender, sexual preference, historical) and their associated beliefs and values are not even considered in many of the engineering identity constructs. Therefore, in alignment with the National Science Foundation’s Broadening Participation in Engineering program, this project intends to enable and encourage the participation of all citizens in the engineering enterprise by challenging these patterns. 

This project will take on a holistic approach to enhance “servingness” at HSIs and beyond by creating an identity affirming culture in engineering education. Hispanic, LatinX/e/a/o, XicanX/e/a/o undergraduate students, inclusive of their intersectionalities (HLX+), in engineering will participate in a program that nurtures holistic identity development and empowerment informed by Anzaldua’s Path to Conocimiento (i.e., Conocimiento). Path to Conocimiento is framework that contributes to their making meaning of the transitional journey that naturally occurs during higher education. Students will engage in autoethnographic inquiry to make meaning of their experiences as HLX+ in engineering education and then identify where and how they can dismantle cultural barriers or transform hegemonic structures. The Conocimiento will also provide the context to explore HLX+ Cultural, Community, Racial, Ethnic (CCoRE) values. The research component, using a combination of qualitative and participatory research methods, will seek to answer: (1) What are the salient CCoRE values that HLX+ undergrads bring with them into their engineering education?; (2) Where and how do HLX+ undergrads experience conflicts with their CCoRE values during their engineering education?; and (3) How do HLX+ undergrads navigate conflicts with their CCoRE values when empowered with their own conocimiento? This new knowledge will be used to develop a workshop to inspire and aid faculty to create an identity affirming culture within their research teams and/or in their classes, departments, and beyond. Ultimately, this project seeks to (1) empower students to recognize and disrupt hegemonic engineering education structures and, by extension, the profession, (2) dismantle cultural barriers that dissuade historically minoritized and marginalized people from participating in engineering education/careers, and (3) transform the dominant engineering culture by inspiring radically inclusive values, particularly among faculty and HLX+.

(2) From the perspective of key university agents (e.g., advising staff, faculty, administrators), what are the relevant structures, policies, and practices that shape community college transfer student degree trajectories and opportunities in computer science? The inquiry will be informed by social cognitive career theory (SCCT) and theories of administrative burden and street-level bureaucracy. The quantitative stream of this work will rely on descriptive and multivariate analysis of student surveys and registrar data. The qualitative stream of this research will use phenomenological methods, relying on student and university agent interview data to better understand the experienced phenomena (i.e., structures, policies, and practices that shape transfer student trajectories in computer science). This approach aligns with the research questions, which collectively focus on how participants with varying positionalities (e.g., student, staff, faculty) make meaning of the structures, policies, and practices that shape community college transfer student success and degree trajectories.

Stronger Internet security is vital to the well-being of all Americans in today's society; the NDSS Symposium provides a leading venue for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners to exchange experiences and strengthen common approaches for safeguarding Internet security.  Funding student attendees who would otherwise be financially unable to attend helps develop the next generation of talent.  In particular, the NDSS Symposium seeks to bring underrepresented groups, such as youth and women, into the Internet security field to broaden the talent pool available to both cybersecurity research and practice.  Students will be selected based on their evidence of interest, leadership, and collaboration around security-related topics; their financial need and benefits of attending for both themselves and the conference; and their ability to bring a wide variety of perspectives to the field.

Analysis and combinatorics can be seen as two different approaches toward using mathematics to study the physical world. In analysis, which evolved from calculus, the approach is based on continuous and dynamical methods of an infinite nature. By contrast, combinatorics seeks to understand complicated and subtle patterns in discrete (and often finite) systems. The proposed research centers on using model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to bridge these two different perspectives. Model theory is the abstract study of mathematical objects using properties that can be described with formal language and semantics. The leverage provided by model theory stems from the fact that two mathematical objects can appear substantially different in nature, but share enough semantic properties so that an understanding of one object leads to understanding of the other. This approach has led to significant breakthroughs in mathematical research, which will be further developed in this project. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will also allow for collaboration between researchers and students from a variety of mathematical backgrounds and levels.

The broad theme of the research proposed is the use of continuous logic (model theory for metric structures) to develop a stronger foundation for the interaction between analysis and combinatorics described above, with a focus on arithmetic combinatorics in noncommutative groups. There are two main goals. The first is to prove a fully general arithmetic regularity lemma valid for arbitrary groups using a Radon-Nikodym-type strategy (similar to the nonstandard proof of Szemeredi's regularity lemma for graphs). Previous attempts toward such a theorem have been impeded by fundamental drawbacks of classical (discrete) logic, and this project proposes a new strategy based on continuous logic. This theorem is envisioned as a necessary step in the ongoing development of a model-theoretic framework for arithmetic combinatorics. The second main goal is based on recent work on the structure of stable functions on groups, which establishes a connection to existing results in arithmetic combinatorics (e.g., on approximate groups). A majority of these results are only currently understood at a qualitative level, and thus a quantitative understanding of stable functions on groups should lead to quantitative breakthroughs in these other areas. Moreover, model theoretic ideas were previously successful in obtaining a quantitative analysis of stable sets in groups. This project will pursue an analogous quantitative analysis of stable functions, motivated by applications to arithmetic combinatorics.

Located in the central gyres of the subtropical ocean, these regions are too remote to receive significant nutrient inputs from land or from deeper waters by vertical mixing. The low supply of nutrients should result in reduced levels of photosynthesis and less complex food webs. However, observations instead indicate that life grows at rates similar to regions which receive higher nutrient supplies. Our project seeks to determine what the missing sources of nutrients are that help sustain these ecosystems. This work will focus on nitrogen bound within dissolved organic molecules that are produced in nutrient-rich regions, including coastal California, and then transported laterally to the ‘ocean desert’ of the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. A one-month research expedition will leave from San Diego, CA and end in Honolulu, HI USA to study the production, accumulation, chemical composition, and utilization of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and link it to photosynthesis occurring across the North Pacific. The new knowledge gained about the role of DON in satisfying the nutrient requirements of the subtropical North Pacific will be used to construct computer models that gauge the global importance of this nutrient source to subtropical ocean ecosystems. 

Additional nitrogen (N) sources beyond subsurface nitrate (NO3-) and N2 fixation fluxes are required to explain observed net community production (NCP) within subtropical ocean ecosystems. Numerical models indicate that laterally supplied allochthonous DON may support 10-60% of NCP in oligotrophic subtropical gyres, but with large uncertainties. The proposed work will field test hypotheses concerning the biological production and consumption of marine DON, and whether allochthonous DON is a significant organic nutrient source sustaining NCP. A North Pacific cruise will use observations of DON concentration, chlorophyll a concentration, and N isotopes [DON's 15N/14N ratio, and NO3-'s 15N/14N ratio] to identify regions of net DON production and consumption in the context of net and gross biological productivity estimated using O2/Ar and triple Oxygen isotopic measurements, respectively. Novel organic geochemistry tools will be used to identify the molecular composition of the allochthonous DON. The influence of depth on DON consumption will be investigated using ship-board incubations that expose surface DON collected across gradients in surface NO3- to microbial communities from several depth intervals. Finally, a new semi-labile DON tracer will be encoded in a global ocean biogeochemistry model, fashioned to behave like the allochthonous DON characterized from the field observations. The DON and isotopic data sets will serve to constrain model parameterizations of semi-labile DON cycling. The state-of-the-art model of semi-labile DON cycling will be used to quantitatively assess the portion of NCP sustained by allochthonous DON delivery to the North Pacific subtropical gyre and extend this assessment across the global ocean.

However, many of the polymers used exhibit low thermal stability and high flammability, especially biopolymers such as polylactic acid (PLA), which is one of the most common feedstocks for fused filament fabrication (FFF). One potential solution to this problem is to print polymer nanocomposites.  However, the layered structure and bonding in FFF can lead to anisotropic properties and internal voids or gaps between printed layers that are not found in their counterparts manufactured using thermocompression. These properties may affect the ignition and combustion behaviors of 3D-printed polymer nanocomposites. The principal aims of this project are to systematically study heat and mass transfer dynamics of 3D-printed PLA nanocomposites with FFF and to better understand their effects on ignition and combustion behaviors. The insight from this project may guide the design of new flame-retardant systems and improved fire safety for 3D-printed biopolymer products, which could reduce the frequency and severity of fires. This proposed research is a multidisciplinary project that integrates research and educational activities to enhance the pool of multidisciplinary engineers and professionals in local communities. 

The goal of this project is understand the heat transfer and mass transfer associated with the ignition and combustion of 3D-printed biopolymer nanocomposites. Literature is scarce on the use of polymer nanocomposites for 3D-printing applications to reduce their flammability hazards, although this technique is effective in bulk polymers manufactured using thermocompression.  Samples manufactured using thermocompression show a uniform dispersion of nanoparticles, leading to a homogeneous and isotropic material structure. By comparison, samples manufactured using 3D printing show different structural characteristics. Besides the anisotropic properties and the presence of voids, 3D-printed parts often are not uniformly filled; instead, they have internal infill patterns that provide structural support while minimizing material usage. The choice of infill density can affect the heat transfer and mass transfer in the anisotropic condensed phase of burning polymers. However, few studies have been performed to investigate these effects and gain a fundamental understanding. The project will fill this knowledge gap with three main objectives: (i) synthesize biopolymer nanocomposites-based filaments for 3D printing, (ii) manufacture samples using FFF and determine structural characterization, and (iii) study ignition and combustion behaviors of 3D-printed PLA nanocomposite samples under well-controlled fire conditions. This project is expected to promote the development of performance-efficient and cost effective flame retardant biopolymer nanocomposites for sustainable 3D printing applications.

Existing workhorse control and optimization methodologies assume a large separation of time scales, sufficient to justify complete decoupling of the optimization and control tasks. However, this assumption is increasingly invalid for modern critical infrastructure and social platforms. This project represents a new approach for optimal and reliable decision-making on time scales comparable to the dynamics of the underlying physical and logistic systems, by using new mathematical principles of analysis and synthesis to control the collective behavior of agents and the underlying physical dynamics. The key concept is to continuously drive the dynamical system towards solution trajectories of optimization problems that have costs, constraints, and inputs which change over time. In the context of future transportation networks, the approach is well-aligned with the objective of moving people and cargo efficiently and sustainably, and with the integration of connected and autonomous vehicles. Similar application opportunities occur in areas such as energy, robotics, and autonomous systems, with the common feature of interconnected cooperative and non-cooperative agents interacting via multiple heterogeneous physical and virtual networks. The project will also impact undergraduate and graduate engineering students, and K-12 students through a comprehensive outreach and educational plan that includes STEM camps, engaging activities to promote the recruitment of female students and students from under-served communities and minority schools into the STEM pipeline, and curriculum enhancement initiatives.

Traditional decision-making architectures in networked systems and critical infrastructures are grounded on explicit spatio-temporal boundaries between model-based network-level optimization (producing setpoints in a feed-forward fashion) and local closed-loop control (regulating the dynamical system to the setpoints while rejecting disturbances). The modus operandi of these traditional architectures has worked well in settings where the underlying dynamics of the physical systems are slower than the solution time required by network-level optimization tasks, network models and data structures are available, and problem inputs can be pervasively collected in a timely and reliable manner. Such assumptions, however, are becoming increasingly inadequate in dynamic settings where batch approaches fail to solve the underlying optimization problems on a time scale that matches the dynamics of the networked physical systems, physical models (embedded into the optimization task) are difficult to estimate accurately, and (unknown) disturbances evolve rapidly and unpredictably. This project will generate new mathematical principles for the synthesis and analysis of online data-based algorithms that drive the collective behavior of agents and physical dynamics to desired operational points. In particular, the desired equilibrium points coincide with solution trajectories of time-varying optimization problems formalizing performance metrics and operational constraints associated with the dynamical system. The interconnected-system framework under study compresses the time scales between control and optimization tasks to continuously drive the dynamic behavior of physical systems to network-optimal and stable points. The research seeks to expand the class of problems to which this project vision can be applied, develop predictive controllers with information streams, and synthesize novel distributed algorithmic solutions for interconnected systems.  The technical approach focuses on networked transportation systems as the arena to materialize the theoretical and algorithmic advances and provide innovative control and optimization strategies. Beyond transportation, benefits are expected to propagate in the broader optimization and control communities, with applications in multiple domains including control of epidemics, robotic networks, social networks, and energy infrastructures.

A team of students from the University of Buffalo has been selected as the Graduate Student Symposium Planning Committee (GSSPC) to organize this symposium at the ACS Fall 2024 National Meeting in Denver, Colorado. The GSSPC is responsible for all aspects of the symposium, including selecting a topic, inviting speakers, securing funds, and recruiting and mentoring the next GSSPC. The symposium's theme, ""Breaking the Mold: Building Communication to Promote Green and Sustainable Practices,"" revolves around examining and discussing innovative approaches to implementing green and sustainable practices in both academia and industry. The primary objectives of the symposium are: (1) to raise awareness about the relevance and need for green chemistry in academic and industrial settings, (2) to establish a collaborative platform for the exchange of best practices among the attendees, and (3) to promote the notion that green and sustainable practices are achievable without compromising quality, cost, and efficiency. To maximize engagement and knowledge dissemination, the symposium will consist of two events: 1) Lectures by invited speakers (i.e., individuals from academia, scientists who work at government agencies, and active members working in industry), and 2) Green Connect: A networking event held to facilitate engagement among speakers, sponsors, and attendees. This gathering will create an environment conducive to forging meaningful connections that could transcend the symposium. Invited speakers have been thoughtfully chosen by the planning committee as distinguished lecturers to ensure a comprehensive and holistic perspective of the dynamic and evolving landscapes of green and sustainable chemistry.

The symposium aims to address the pressing need for environmental protection and sustainability by fostering essential dialogue between the attendees and representatives from academic institutions, industries, and non-profit organizations. Moreover, the symposium intends to promote equity and diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility in STEM.

However, typically well-intentioned parents can also expose children to known risks such as identity theft, bullying, misuse of photos, or threats from child predators. Despite these risks, many parents continue to think of sharing their child's information as being similar to sharing more general posts on social media. Across various parenting styles, parents may need to be informed about these risks if we are to protect children against them. Towards the broader goal of improving the welfare of children and protecting them against current and future cyber threats, this project is focused on a scientific method for designing educational materials to foster more responsible, and less risky, parental sharing of children’s information online. Students and the public will be participating in this research.

The objective of this project is to establish a more comprehensive understanding of parental sharing in the context of diverse family interaction styles and provide empirically validated educational materials that support informed parental sharing and young children’s privacy. In doing so, the proposed work is investigating privacy education interventions that are preventative, can be easily disseminated, and impact broader social norms. This proposal focuses on parents and their preteen children. At this age, children display increased autonomy as they approach the minimum allowable age for most social media use. At the same time, they are susceptible to influence from their parents and have typically not established the agency to prevent unwanted parental sharing. The overarching objective will be addressed via a three-phased plan to: 1) Demonstrate how family interaction styles contribute to parental sharing practices and outcomes; 2) Identify strategies to inform safe and responsible parental sharing based on insights drawn from parents and their children; and 3) Empirically-validate educational interventions to inform safer parental sharing standards.

With the completion of the human genome project, more and more SNPs have been identified as biomarkers for life-threatening diseases. Detecting such SNPs is of particular importance to the fields of cancer diagnosis, pathogen detection, and various health condition monitoring. The standard methods to detect SNPs rely on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), but are largely limited by their poor sensitivity and bad accuracy. This CAREER project will exploit the newly discovered CRISPR technology to detect disease-related SNPs, improving human health. To provide broader impacts on a national level, this project will pursue the following two education and outreach goals: 1) broaden participation in careers in biotechnology and 2) equip undergraduate and graduate students with the required biotechnology knowledge and hands-on experience. 

In bacteria and archaea cells, CRISPR was developed as an adaptive defense system against viral infections. In addition to gene editing, CRISPR technology has been applied to detect nucleic acids in the past few years. This NSF CAREER project aims to study the fundamental properties of CRISPR Cas nucleases through their non-specific collateral activities (also named “trans-cleavage” activity) and apply the knowledge to detect disease-related SNPs. The central hypothesis is that systematic characterization and optimization of the trans-cleavage activities of the CRISPR Cas nucleases (Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14) will provide a solid foundation to develop novel biosensing approaches for the ultra-accurate detection of disease-related SNPs (less than 0.1% SNPs in wild type can be detected).

Behavioral research has historically and almost exclusively taken place in small laboratories with small numbers of participants. In the era of ""big data,"" scientists have realized that huge numbers of volunteer ""citizen scientists"" can conduct studies anywhere around the world using their own smartphones, wearables, and computers.  Data collected from one such large study can answer questions that would normally need hundreds or thousands of small laboratory experiments. This project's impact will be to facilitate and democratize large-scale behavioral research by planning a community of professional and amateur researchers who use and build upon an open-source software platform used for designing and running such studies. 
 
The project has three components. First, the project seek to conduct ecosystem discovery to identify the needs of potential users, scope potential partnerships with other open-source projects, and find potential collaborators at non-profits and in industry. Second, the organization and governance activities will be established a formal governing structure and implemented using Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices, including enhanced automated testing, continuous integration, and robust security measures. Finally, community building activities will support existing users and contributors and onboard new collaborators through a series of workshops, hackathons, online tutorials, and targeted lab exchanges.

Because they use audio and video, and these can show information about a participant's behavior and environment, people choose to turn off microphones or cameras when they have related privacy concerns. However, microphones and cameras may leak other kinds of information beyond the semantics of what is seen and heard, raising privacy risks people are unaware of.  This project's goal is to examine those risks, looking at the many sensitive ""micro signals"" that are sent over the network through the legitimate visual and acoustic channels of video conferencing. These signals are too tiny for humans to recognize, but detectable by machines, and through careful signal processing they might inadvertently reveal information about people's location, off-camera behavior, interaction with their computer, and other things people might want to keep private. Through better understanding the risks and developing methods to mitigate them, this project will advance understanding of side channel attacks and increase online meeting privacy. The project also contributes to cyber security education through curriculum development, demo platform implementation, graduate/undergraduate student training, K-12 involvement, public outreach, and underrepresented student engagement in research.

This project advances the knowledge of acoustic sensing and visual sensing and brings the security protection of video conferencing down to the micro signal level. It exploits the two-way audio channel of video conferencing to send malicious acoustic signals remotely, which sense the user's current physical surroundings and return to the attacker with location-specific echo signals. Deep learning algorithms are developed to circumvent the echo cancellation mechanisms enforced by audio streaming systems, maximizing the retrieval of sensitive echoes for attackers. The project further uncovers the user's on-screen inputs during video calls, which are out of the webcam's view and believed to be safe, including online voting choices, touchscreen device inputs, and physical keyboard typing. The user's eye motions, keystroke-induced camera vibrations, and the monitor's screen lights are exploited for privacy inference. To prevent privacy leakage from micro signals, this project develops both targeted defense approaches, which address each attack separately, and general micro-signal removal techniques based on compression and decompression, which can handle different micro-signal attacks and their variants.

This project studies a class of random growth models taking place in different geometric settings and will develop new tools effective for these structures; the aim is to understand the behavior of these systems and the impact of the underlying geometry on this behavior. These systems, for example, might be used to model the growth of cancer along a wall or a cylinder. 

The extensive algebraic structure underlying integrable or exactly solvable models without boundary has been successfully used to study a variety of probabilistic questions for these models. Many of these models are expected to exhibit universality, meaning that the behavior studied should occur in a wide variety of other models. However, once non-trivial boundary conditions are imposed, our understanding is incomplete. The proposal aims to develop a better understanding of the algebraic structures involved once boundary conditions are imposed and to use this structure to attack probabilistic problems. In particular, the work aims to find new hidden symmetries for these models and to establish asymptotic results via new exact formulas for models with boundary.

The meeting is open to all with interest in CompMath, with a particular emphasis on attracting current and recent PIs of the CompMath program, as well as early career researchers such as junior professors, postdocs, and Ph.D. students working in CompMath. The meeting aims to achieve three primary goals: (1) Community building in CompMath by bringing together the CompMath community to strengthen and expand the network of NSF-supported PIs. Parallel research sessions serve as a platform to highlight the achievements of the PIs and the CompMath program; (2) Engagement of early career scientists through a poster session designed to highlight their works, activities aimed at the professional development of early career researchers, and travel support for these attendees; (3) A forward-looking report will be compiled by the organizers by leveraging community input that presents an overview of discussions during the meeting and summarizes any strategic community recommendations and outcomes from the meeting focusing on the major achievements of CompMath, current challenges, and exciting new research directions.

The CompMath disciplinary program at NSF supports a variety of research endeavors, which include more classical foci of numerical analysis, PDE solving algorithms, and mathematical optimization, along with the more recent and/or nascent subfields of randomized linear algebra, computational imaging, and mathematical aspects of data science and machine learning. Investigators from these subfields indeed attend their own discipline-specific conferences and professional events and also take opportunities to attend meetings in related fields. However, there is a dearth of meeting opportunities between a large collection of researchers who focus on the broad collection of foundational research questions in CompMath. Because the community of PIs supported by project awards from the NSF CompMath program does not have targeted events/conferences where the community broadly meets, the main motivation for this proposal is to organize such a professional meeting. The PI meeting will feature focused presentation sessions where PI’s will highlight their NSF-supported work in the previously described technical research areas.

Bioinspired materials are artificial materials whose design, properties, and/or function mimic aspects of naturally occurring materials. Living organisms have developed exquisite approaches to assemble highly sophisticated materials, for example, for use as structural load-bearing components or to enable complex functions such as sensing and motion. The interdisciplinary field of bioinspired materials research focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of the design, synthesis, and function of naturally occurring materials and uses this understanding to create synthetic materials and systems. Examples of bio-inspired materials include burr-seed-inspired hook-and-loop fasteners (Velcro), underwater adhesives that take inspiration from mussels’ ability to stick to rocks, power sources that imitate the electric organ of electric fish, and cell-mimicking nanoparticles for drug delivery. This NSF grant supports the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Bioinspired Materials, which brings together some 200 researchers, primarily from the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, and medicine. The meeting is held in Les Diablerets, Switzerland, June 16-21, 2024. A large number of the participants are from the U.S., and more than half of the meeting’s participants are junior researchers, i.e., graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and early-stage professors. GRCs provide immersive experiences in which cutting-edge, unpublished science is presented and discussed. The program includes oral and poster sessions, discussions over meals, and social engagements between sessions. A two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will precede the main meeting and offer junior scientists to discuss their projects among themselves. A Power Hour – a unique platform found at GRCs – is devoted to discussing strategies for the advancement of women and members of underrepresented minority groups in bioinspired materials science. The meeting’s format enables the trans-disciplinary development of new ideas, allows junior researchers to engage with established senior investigators, and serves to build a research community.

Technical description

Higher yields of bioproducts for each batch manufactured results in lower costs, which is currently the number one problem throughout the biotechnology industry. For example, the cost of a cultured meat burger is $100, orders of magnitude higher than the traditional alternatives. The cost of a gene therapy cure is $2.2 million, which is too high for the average person to afford. By bringing this new technology to market to engineer higher yielding cells, costs will be dramatically reduced for these bioproducts, allowing growth of the biotechnology industry.

This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a high-throughput cell screening technology designed to isolate cells based on their ability to produce higher yields of a desired bioproduct. Using this technology, cells are placed into hollow microparticles that are replacements for test tubes to measure the yields that cells produce. The outer shell is composed of a synthetic, porous hydrogel called poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG) that allows for continuous solution exchange between the inner compartment and the external environment. This allows for nutrients to be rapidly replenished, enabling long-term growth and production assays that were not possible with previous microfluidic screening technologies. The microparticles can be sorted via fluorescent activated cell sorters (FACS) at a rate of 75,000 cells/colonies per hour, orders of magnitude higher than the alternatives. Cells can be released post-sort by allowing the cells to grow out of the particles or by adding chemical reagents to the particles to break down the outer shell.

Its primary objective is to uncover novel connections between two currently active research domains that have developed independently until recently: random permutations and random geometry. The emerging interplay between permutons (limits of random permutations) and random geometric objects arising in quantum physics and statistical mechanics (such as Schramm–Loewner evolution curves and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces) will play a fundamental role in generating significant advancements in both fields. This will involve formulating novel theories for universal random permutons and random directed metrics, expanding existing ones, and effectively resolving long-standing problems on meanders and meandric systems. 

The three main objectives of this research project are, first, to investigate the problem of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations from a novel angle, which involves linking it to directed metrics in planar maps. The goal is to construct a 'quantum version' of the universal Kardar-Parisi-Zhang geometry, i.e., the directed landscape. Second, to study the geometry of random meanders and broader statistical physics models involving crossing fully packed loops on planar maps. The objective is to tackle the long-standing open problem of determining the scaling limit of random uniform meanders and meandric permutations. Third to establish connections between the limits of d-dimensional permutations and new scale-invariant d-dimensional random geometries introduced in the physical literature. The aim is to begin developing a novel d-dimensional theory of random geometries and permutons. The project offers opportunities for education and outreach to high school and undergraduate students, as well as mentoring of undergraduate and Ph.D. students.

By investigating how people navigate complex state bureaucratic systems that require major shifts to their lives, this dissertation research advances scientific understandings of how communities experience the complexities and opportunities of new infrastructure in both locally specific and broadly similar ways. Findings from this research will be disseminated to better understand state development projects that seem banal but might instead be major and meaningful changes for people. While building roads and requiring different forms of licensure seem to encourage safer and more accessible mobility, how are they actually experienced on the ground? This project also brings historically underrepresented and geographically significant groups into the discovery process of scientific knowledge.   

This doctoral research project investigates local and individual experiences of state formation through an ethnographic study of the role of legalized and certified mobility in modes of new state bureaucratic governance. This research examines (1) how mobility is remade under new forms of state road regulations, driving license requirements, and discipline around mobility and (2) how individuals experience, navigate, adapt, and respond to these new forms of state intervention in their day-to-day lives. Research methods for this project consist of ethnographic participant observation, semi-structured interviews, ethnographic fieldnotes, oral histories of mobile communities, and reviews of official documents. Data analysis will focus on both contextualizing nomads’ experiences of state interventions and situating this study in relation to similar cases elsewhere in the world. In doing so, this research contributes to scientific theories of state formation, Indigenous knowledge, modes of bureaucratic infrastructures, and state development projects as modernization.

Until the inaugural Gordon Research Conference (GRC), no conference or professional meeting was explicitly dedicated to basic science ultrasound research with the goal of improving diagnostic ultrasound. The first GRC on in vivo ultrasound imaging found an exceptional reception and outstanding feedback. Discussion among the 2022 participants quickly demonstrated the strong need to propose a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). GRC and GRS will provide an intimate forum for scientific exchange among scientists and researchers whose primary area of research is the development of novel biomedical ultrasound techniques and approaches. The proposed inaugural GRS will feature 3 sessions with dedicated discussion leaders and 11 student speakers selected from abstract submissions. A 4-member panel discussion on mentorship will conclude the GRS and create a transition to the GRC for 5 days of fostering discourse and mentoring between trainees and researchers/educators.

In soils, many bacterial strains carry genes that encode for antibiotic resistance (AR). The use of treated wastewater for irrigation has emerged as an important source of antibiotics in soils.  In agriculture fields irrigated with treated wastewater, previous studies have found that antibiotics are frequently detected in soils. In addition, some studies have reported that irrigation intensity and the occurrence of AR markers in irrigation water are correlated to the abundance of those markers in soils. However, a fundamental understanding of the fate, transport, and reactivity of antibiotics in agricultural soils during irrigation with treated/polluted wastewater has remained elusive. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to advance the fundamental understanding of the reactive transport processes that occur during the infiltration of antibiotic-polluted water and their impact on the levels of AR bacteria in agricultural soils. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigator proposes to test the hypothesis that changes in the abundance and persistence of AR bacteria in agricultural soils are directly linked to the physicochemical interactions between soils and antibiotics during the infiltration of treated/polluted irrigation wastewater. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge on how soils function as natural filters that accumulate and/or degrade antibiotic pollutants and control their availability to soil micro-organisms. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of two graduate students and one undergraduate student at Texas A&M University.

Antibiotic pollutants are a group of chemicals that infiltrate through soils during irrigation when treated wastewater is used as alternative to address water scarcity in agriculture. Despite the importance of soils in assimilating antibiotic pollution, little is known about how the flow of antibiotic-polluted water impacts the spread and persistence of antibiotic resistance (AR) in soils during irrigation. This CAREER project will address these critical knowledge gaps through the integration of field investigations, bench scale lab experiments, and process-based modeling. The specific objectives of the research are to (1) identify the factors that control the persistence of antibiotics and the amplification of AR markers in soils irrigated with treated wastewater, (2) identify and quantify the soil-antibiotic interactions that induce persistence and horizontal transfer of AR genes among soil bacteria, and (3) elucidate key reactive processes controlling the amplification of AR in soils that receive a mix of antibiotics and AR bacteria in polluted water. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge about the AR attenuation capacity of soil ecosystems under the continuous infiltration of antibiotic polluted wastewater. To implement the educational and mentoring goals of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator proposes (PI) to leverage existing programs and resources at Texas A&M University to (i) engage students in the design, implementation, and deployment of a human-like dynamic conversation interface (educational chatbot), and (ii) use the educational chatbot to promote interactive communication between virtual STEM scholars and K-12 student audiences. The PI plans to build upon these educational activities to design and implement new pedagogical frameworks that foster equal participation and a sense of belonging among all students.

Cancer causes the death of more than 600,000 Americans each year. Researchers would like to develop a test to identify cancer biomarkers in blood or saliva that detects early onset of the disease as survival rate increases with early detection. Research demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy, a commonly used method to provide a structural fingerprint of molecules, can identify biomarkers of many types of cancers such as breast, colorectal, ovarian, and others. The Raman signal from cancer biomarkers is very weak and needs to be amplified to be reliable. This technology achieves this amplification using Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), which provides a substrate that may improve the signal and allow development of a test for the early detection of cancer.

This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. The solution is based on the development of a Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrate using nanotechnology. The substrate is composed of silver (Ag) nanowires coated with nickel (Ni). The properties and structure of the substrate have been studied using electron microscopy, quantum mechanics, and multi-physics-based calculations. The Ag-Ni nanowire substrate has shown high reliability and reproducibility and meets Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for clinical trials. The lack of a commercial substrate has been a roadblock to develop Raman-based cancer detection tests. If successful, this technology may allow researchers to develop routine diagnostic tests from a blood or salvia sample for the early detection of cancer.

Diaspora communities – people who reside in one country but maintain attachments to their real or imagined “homeland” – have been increasingly mobilized for or against their country of origin. What shapes diasporic individuals’ attitudes toward the homeland and their tendency to mobilize politically on this basis? This research answers this question using a survey experiment that randomly exposes individuals to one of three narratives: (1) a narrative that emphasizes contemporary danger for one’s kin in the homeland; (2) a narrative that emphasizes shared trauma and common suffering; and (3) a narrative that emphasizes discrimination and rejection in the diaspora’s country of residence. Doing so allows us to assess the persuasive impact of these narratives and identify whether they resonate across different sociodemographic subgroups within the diaspora.

The burgeoning literature on diaspora mobilization highlights three ideational factors that shape the attitudes of diaspora communities toward their “homeland”: (1) perceptions of contemporary danger for one’s kin in the homeland; (2) narratives about shared trauma and common suffering; and (3) a sense of discrimination and rejection in the diaspora’s country of residence. However, there is little rigorous empirical evidence assessing the impact of these factors at the individual level. This research asks whether references to danger in the homeland, shared historical trauma, or current discrimination move the diaspora’s attachment to its purported “homeland,” the diaspora’s tendency to mobilize, and the diaspora’s support of their country of residence’s policies toward the “homeland.” Using experimental methods, this research also examines whether these factors operate uniformly across different sociodemographic subgroups within the diaspora. Investigating how different narratives shape homeland attachment across subgroups will further researchers’ understanding about the preservation and reproduction of diasporic identity, particularly among younger generations who did not directly experience the historic trauma, dislocation, and discrimination. Moreover, our project will also contribute to better understanding of how references to shared trauma affect group attitudes and behavior.

For a week during the summer, these scientists and researchers from universities, companies, hospitals and national/government laboratories from around the country and the world, come together in a quiet setting on a college campus in Maine to present their latest results, discoveries and inventions and to discuss these with one another. An important component of this particular conference is that more than half of the attendees are scientists who are the beginning of their careers (graduate students and the like) who will have the unique opportunity to hear from and interact with the well-known and established scientists and leaders in their field. The conference also has made a strong effort to bring together a very diverse group of attendees with close to 40% being female, more than 1/3 of the attendees coming from countries outside of the US and a significant number being part of traditionally underrepresent groups in science and engineering. One of the results of this from previous conferences like this one, has been that the participants get to really know each other and start to work together. They become colleagues and collaborators and in some cases friends for life. Ultimately this means that together they can make more research progress than each person can on their own which in turn benefits society and ultimate the patients that benefit from these new technologies. During formal presentations and informal discussions the overall goal of the meeting is to work together and exchange ideas in order to improve our understanding of how light interacts with biological tissue and how lasers and other optical technologies can be used to diagnose and treat diseases such as cancer or heart disease and use those high tech approaches to understand how certain parts of the body such as the brain actually work.

The theme of the 2024 GRC-OPMB conference is “Biophotonics: From Fundamental Physics to Applied Physiology”, The conference will consist of 9 scientific sessions with 3 or 4 invited speakers each. Each session will focus on a biophotonic technology, research question or application area. Topics within a session span the full spectrum from fundamental biophysics to biological science question to clinical medicine and explore the current and future use of these advances for improving health and wellness. Most of the topics and sessions directly align with the interest and mission of the NSF, especially the sessions on ‘Quantum Biophotonics’, ‘AI/ML in Optical Imaging’, ‘Modeling and Theory of Laser-Tissue Interactions’ and throughout the conference and its participants there will be a significant focus on early career investigators and diversity. In addition, there will be 4 poster sessions throughout the week where all attendees are encouraged to present their latest research findings.

ZBLAN can unlock radical performance improvements for telecommunication products, fiber lasers, and remote sensors. However, commonplace manufacturing techniques cannot develop ZBLAN without light-scattering defects, rendering glass to applications but ineffective for many of the most important ones. Based on modern automation, robotics, and processing techniques, this project builds a path to manufacturing this fiber to limit the growth of light-scattering defects. Moreover, the manufacturing process is further enhanced when performed in space. Due to the exceptional characteristics of microgravity, it is possible to produce a ZBLAN product devoid of scattering defects, offering a transformational leap in optical transmission capabilities. After successful preliminary tests, this project will develop the necessary hardware to develop ZBLAN at scale, both on Earth and in microgravity. This project is expected to catalyze a high growth, high throughput, scalable and profitable in-space production process with meaningful societal impact.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an instrument capable of rapidly casting molten ZBLAN glass through minute-scale apertures, aiming to streamline manufacturing by eliminating bubbles and restricting defect growth. This project seeks to overcome the challenges historically hindering ZBLAN optical preform production. The approach will produce high-value products that can radically improve optical capabilities by identifying a method to create precise preform core dimensions. Currently, state-of-the-art manufacturing processes lack the accuracy and standardization required to meet ZBLAN's stringent tolerances. This project leverages extensive theoretical calculations to optimize the melting, casting, and annealing of ZBLAN, which is crucial for minimizing crystalline defects and maximizing transparency. By leveraging novel automation techniques, harnessing the unique properties of microgravity, and effectively managing heat loads, this project is pioneering the in-space manufacturing industry, as demonstrated by the company's recent ISS experiment where astronauts pulled ~10km of ZBLAN in space. The project will develop an automated ZBLAN manufacturing technology to enable scalable terrestrial and in-space ZBLAN production. It will allow the company to develop new optical products - starting with free-space mid-wave infrared optical links. This innovative approach is poised to pioneer in-space manufacturing and propel the development of high-value ZBLAN products.

These environmental changes have important effects on how inorganic nutrients (Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium) are stored and cycled in the soils of temperate forests. Inorganic nutrients are essential for plant growth and are sourced to soils from mineral weathering, deposition from the atmosphere, and leaf litter from plants. While roots are known for their role in extracting inorganic nutrients for plants, they can contribute organic matter to help store inorganic nutrients in soils. This research project explores how leaf litter and surface roots promote inorganic nutrient storage in soils and the extent of their codependence. To understand climatic controls on leaf litter and roots for inorganic nutrient cycling, the researchers will leverage a network of research sites spanning from the warm temperate forests of Virginia to the cold temperate forests of northern New England. The findings will be used to inform the U.S. Forest Service and several state Forestry and Natural Resources Departments of the current and future inorganic nutrient cycling in their forests. Furthermore, the research site in Massachusetts will serve as an instructional tool for university and community college courses. 

The primary objective of the project is to quantify the codependence of leaf litter and roots on Mg, P, K, and Ca stabilization in temperate forest soil. Leaf litter and roots may act synergistically to stabilize inorganic nutrients in the mineral soil through generating organic matter and aggregation. To avoid the common issue of heterogeneity of soil materials and duration of development, the project will leverage soil columns buried three years ago, containing a quartz-feldspar-kaolinite mixture to examine the effect of leaf litter and tree roots on inorganic nutrients in mineral soil. Researchers will quantify the rate of inorganic nutrient stabilization in bulk soils and use microprobe analyses to examine rhizosphere and microaggregation. Moreover, the project will utilize existing litterfall and atmospheric deposition monitoring to estimate nutrient cycling budgets. When examined across the climate gradient, the findings can be used to predict future shifts in nutrient cycling from shifts in leaf litter-root codependence with changes in climate.

The research objectives include (1) Development of Generalizable Tools: The project aims to build generalizable tools for cyber-physical resilience quantification. By creating stochastic models that integrate cyber connectivity and system dynamics of heterogeneous components, a novel quantification metric will be established. This metric considers both IIoT network features and manufacturing system dynamics through stochastic optimization, revealing system-level risks induced by IIoT connectivity. (2) Rethinking Anomaly Detection: The project will rethink cyber-physical resilience-driven anomaly detection by incorporating system-wide resilience quantification into process-based anomaly detection algorithms. This involves designing novel semi-supervised learning algorithms that incorporate resilience, with a focus on understanding the theories governing detection accuracy and resilience enhancement in high-dimensional data-driven anomaly detection. (3) Collaborative Learning-Based Resilient Control Strategies: The study aims to create collaborative learning-based resilient control strategies. Leveraging reinforcement learning and system connectivity, these strategies enhance a system's adaptability to cyberattacks. This involves exploring the under-explored area of vertical federated reinforcement learning and generating new knowledge regarding the trade-off between the control performance of individual machines and the system's adaptability to adversaries.

Tokenization represents a new frontier in finance that was originally pioneered in blockchain and cryptocurrency, and has many commercial applications to make payments and securities settlement faster, more transparent, and more reliable in the current regulatory environment. FBDAs are not blockchain based and can improve upon existing global payment solutions in making systems more scalable, easier to integrate with other payment systems, and more privacy-enhancing for institutions and consumers. The platform also allows for open sourcing and increased financial inclusion through the digital identity solution which gives the ability to move assets without friction globally. The commercial potential of FBDAs is significant, and tokenization products can be sold to domestic and international commercial and central banks, and allow third-party providers to build out their own financial products. This project will explore the technical market for FBDA-based tokenization and gain user feedback to improve the technology’s commercialization potential. 

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to research and create a production-ready (99.999% availability with defined RPO/RTOs) File-Based Digital Assets (FBDAs) product, a novel tokenization scheme applicable to not only currencies and tokenized deposits, but also to securities and other assets. FBDAs improve upon many of the issues that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and traditional database systems have, particularly in the realms of scalability, interoperability, privacy, and programmability. FBDAs utilize a flexible fixed-denomination asset design that is simpler and more robust than Unspent Transaction Output UTXO-based systems while beating the performance of Account-based systems. In addition, FBDAs allow for a disaggregation of the asset layer from the transaction layer, thereby allowing for easier separation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and from programmability rules for specific transactions. The Phase I project proposes to further explore different design choices of FBDAs and get technical and customer validation on achieving scalability, interoperability and privacy prior to large scale commercialization. The Phase I project will include a sandbox environment to test out different architectural setups, modeling of different financial instruments to expand tokenization potential, and to receive customer feedback from real-world financial institutions.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate numerical analysis design tools that will enable optimization of custom power cells. The research objective is to commercialize the company’s power-generating nanotechnology. These custom Casimir cavities interact with fluctuations of the quantum field to generate continuous power. The innovation in the approach is the customization of the original Casimir cavity concept to incorporate an array of electrically connected and conducting pillars arranged along the midplane of the cavity. With this enhancement, the custom Casimir cavity structure establishes an electrostatic potential between the pillars along the midplane and the cavity walls. The goals and scope of the research are: prediction of tunneling current magnitude for given metal-insulator-metal combination; and optimal selection of combinations of materials and insulator thicknesses. The methods to accomplish validation of software analysis tools are as follows: fabricate numerous metal-insulator-metal samples; conduct laboratory tests to quantify tunneling current performance; update analysis tools with measured performance data. The anticipated technical result is validated software analysis tools to predict the tunneling current magnitude for a given metal-insulator-metal combination of materials.

These systems aim to collaboratively optimize a shared objective. However, they face challenges due to limited throughput across large-scale wireless networks and restricted computational capabilities at networked devices. This research project will develop a novel communication-efficient hierarchical distributed optimization framework that integrates optimization, communication, and machine learning to overcome these challenges. The core innovation is to sample and learn models of the networked agents' behaviors, then use these models to predict the agents' responses to enable informed decision-making while minimizing unnecessary communication and computation at the edge. Adaptive communication and optimization algorithms guided by the learning algorithms are jointly designed to balance the trade-off between cost and accuracy, while exploiting correlation relationships among agents to further enhance efficiency. Towards this goal, the objectives are to develop (1) a general framework for learning-enabled hierarchical distributed optimization algorithms; (2) methods for learning-assisted adaptive quantization, communication, and query; (3) a unifying machine learning framework to attain further tradeoff between communication savings and computational accuracy; and (4) integration and validation of the framework through real-life applications.

The intellectual merit of the project lies in advancing knowledge across three key areas - optimization, communication, and machine learning. New algorithms will be developed for collaborative hierarchical optimization across networked agents. Adaptive communication techniques will be integrated with predictive models to cater lower bandwidth needs. Machine learning methods will be improved to account for uncertainties caused by limited communication and device capabilities. Cohesive fusion of these three areas via exploiting structures of optimization functionals is a notable intellectual outcome of the research.

The broader impacts of this research include advancing real-world applications like sensor networks, cooperative robotics, federated learning, and smart grids, which underpin modern engineering infrastructures. The project will provide an enriching education opportunity for undergraduate students to gain research experience through a comprehensive program across two universities and multiple fields. Furthermore, the findings will be publicized for broad accessibility, including dissemination of results through a YouTube channel and outreach to high school students.

It becomes increasingly essential to ensure fairness in AI algorithms to avoid amplifying inequalities and reinforcing existing prejudice. Although fairness algorithms have achieved great progress recently, when deployed in the real world, they still face practical generalization, privacy and robustness challenges. First, the fairness performance can be significantly degraded under distribution shifts such as domain and temporal shifts. Second, most previous fairness algorithms require direct access to the exact demographic attributes, which is usually infeasible due to people's awareness and legal regulations on privacy. Moreover, research indicates that addressing fairness may increase privacy leakage risks. Third, malicious actors can amplify the demographic bias of AI algorithms by injecting poisoning samples in the training stage or manipulating the data in the inference stage. The goal of this project is to investigate the impact of the aforementioned issues on fairness and develop effective solutions to ensure fairness under generalization, privacy and robustness challenges.

To achieve the research goal, the project systematically investigates the key directions of fairness under domain and temporal shifts, fairness faced with privacy mechanism enforcement and privacy leakage risks, bias amplification attack and defense methods. The project outcomes help advance state-of-the-art research on fair AI and introduce: (1) fairness in domain adaptation from an information-theoretical perspective and a meta-learning framework to ensure temporal-invariant fairness; (2) algorithms improving fairness performance under local differential privacy mechanism and achieving fair graph learning while minimizing the privacy leakage; and (3) poisoning and evasion attacks on fairness properties, as well as model-centric and data-centric defense methods for such attacks accordingly. More broadly, this project will have an immediate and strong impact on improving fairness algorithms in practices, enabling the responsible data analysis with advanced trustworthy AI paradigms in the real world.

The deformation can be elastic, so that when the force is removed the material recovers its original shape. Alternatively, the deformation can be plastic, whereby the material undergoes irreversible changes that may subsequently lead to breakage. Many materials of technological importance exhibit a combination of these two types of deformation depending on the applied force, and are called elasto-plastic. One example are bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys that have an amorphous atomic arrangement in contrast to most metals. BMGs have desirable properties, such as the ability to be processed like plastics, making them attractive candidates for many applications (e.g. next-generation smartphone cases) due to considerable improvements in manufacturing efficiency. However, experimental measurements of BMG breakage properties show wide variations, limiting their usage. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop predictive theoretical and computational models of BMG elasto-plasticity. This project is based on a surprising similarity between the equations for elasto-plastic materials and the equations for incompressible fluids. Using this similarity, computational approaches that were originally developed for fluid flow will be translated to elasto-plasticity. These computational methods will be used in collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture properties of BMGs. The ultimate aim is to provide a practical engineering tool for predicting when elasto-plastic materials will break, and how to best design structures using them. This work will be undertaken as part of an integrated program of research, teaching, and mentorship, and will involve outreach activities in New England, including a local library lecture series.

The projection method of Chorin (1968) is a well-established approach for simulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. This proposal is based on a surprising mathematical correspondence between fluids in the incompressible limit and elasto-plastic solids in the quasi-static limit (when inertia can be neglected). In this proposal, this correspondence is harnessed to translate several modern numerical approaches derived from Chorin's projection method to quasi-static elasto-plasticity, resulting in a practical and powerful set of new simulation tools for a different class of physical problem. Compared to existing techniques, the resultant numerical methods are likely to be especially well-suited to problems involving large plastic deformations. An example type of elasto-plastic material are the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys with many favorable properties such as excellent strength and wear resistance. The numerical methods developed here will be used in a collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture toughness properties of BMGs, with the aim of predicting BMG toughness over a wide range of experimental conditions. The PI plans to expand the graduate curriculum in numerical methods to address a pressing need in this area. Open source software will be released as part of this project, and the PI will train students in best practices to make software accessible to a broad audience.

A distinctive feature of this project is that it will pair human studies with algorithm design to ensure that the computational methods that are developed are informed by an experimentally-grounded understanding of human psychology. In the longer term, this project will bring the fields of psychology and artificial intelligence into closer contact with one another by facilitating the development of shared methodologies and theoretical tools to build trustworthy systems.

The goals of this project are twofold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical framework that formalizes human interpretability in terms of the cognitive cost of the simplest mental models that account for an autonomous system’s behavior. The correspondence of different quantitative predictions of this framework with actual human judgments will be validated through a series of rigorously designed behavioral experiments with human participants. Second, the project will develop new deep reinforcement learning algorithms that use the proposed formalism to optimize for human interpretability directly.

However, such residues are not in random nor uniform patterns, and they often appear as circular spots with a bright center and a dark rim. A closer inspection of this phenomenon reveals that the accumulation of the particles at the edge is facilitated by the fluid flow inside the droplet, which is, in turn, driven by the liquid leaving the free surface of the drop due to evaporation. Apart from its everyday relevance, the evaporation-driven deposition of solutes offers a simple, inexpensive method for assembling complex miniature structures. This method can also be used as a diagnostic tool for forensic analysis, disease examination, and biodetection. The goal of this award is to examine the motion of particles suspended in evaporating colloidal droplets that rest on a substrate, and to link the transport of the colloids to where they finally reside when the droplet is desiccated. The planned studies are coupled with a range of educational activities that involve outreach to underrepresented middle and high school students, mentorship of diverse community college and graduate students, and curriculum development.

This award aims to investigate the transport and aggregation of nonvolatile particles in drying colloidal sessile drops with the ultimate goal of understanding the mechanisms underlying various deposition patterns. Specifically, high-fidelity numerical simulations and theoretical analyses will be used to study the (i) role of the liquid-gas interface in the evolution of the evaporative self-assembly process, (ii) impact of shape and polydispersity on transport and deposition of solutes, and (iii) sensitivity of particle transport and deposition to droplet geometry and shielding effect. The findings of this award will narrow the gap in our current knowledge and fundamental understanding of the evaporation-induced transport, self-assembly, and deposition of particles initially suspended in a sessile drop of a simple liquid. They will also establish a transformative physics-based regime map for deposition patterns that can serve as an engineering guideline for tailoring the system parameters in order to elicit the desired self-assembled structure for a variety of high-tech applications. The map can also be utilized as a diagnostic tool for pinpointing the properties of the suspended particles and the nature of their interactions with themselves, with the liquid-gas interface, and with the substrate.

Many losses are rank-based, playing a critical role in applications like information retrieval, search engines, and recommender systems. They are also valued for training robust models capable of dealing with label noise, outliers, and imbalanced data. Decomposability is a key feature of these losses, allowing them to be broken down into individual components for efficiency and distributed computing. As a bridge between training data and the model, rank-based decomposable loss plays a vital role in machine learning, highlighting the need for thorough study. The project will explore rank-based decomposable loss from two perspectives: aggregate and individual losses. The aggregate loss is the loss over all training data and is constructed from the individual loss of the model for each data sample. The project will concentrate on several key inquiries: What are the general abstract formulations of the rank-based decomposable aggregate and individual losses for machine learning? How to efficiently optimize learning objectives formed based upon them while ensuring convergence? How can these losses be customized or modified to suit different machine learning problems? And what are the statistical behaviors of machine learning algorithms using these losses? The outcomes of this project will unearth new insights into established robust machine learning techniques and give the loss a new twist to consider ranks and decomposability.

This project will be conducted in two interrelated thrusts. The first thrust explores a novel and general rank-based aggregate loss for supervised learning. The focus will encompass efficient algorithms that can optimize this loss with guaranteed convergence, along with streamlined techniques to determine relevant hyperparameters. The developed loss will be connected with distributionally robust optimization to gain insights into its sample-level robustness and the development of new types of rank-based aggregate losses. Additionally, theoretical guarantees will be established for rank-based aggregate losses, including classification calibration, classification consistency, and generalization properties. The second thrust aims to study a general formulation of rank-based individual loss with theoretical analysis, bolstering label-level robustness in multi-class and multi-label learning scenarios. Furthermore, the use of rank-based individual loss will be expanded to tackle fairness learning challenges and investigate the resilience of models trained with this loss against adversarial threats, including verification and defense mechanisms.

The programs for these meetings reflect a strong commitment to diversity initiatives, ensuring that participants from traditionally underrepresented groups are given opportunities to present their research, that they receive registration and travel support, and that those with special needs are appropriately accommodated.  An open forum called the ""Power Hour"" is scheduled within the GRC to promote discussion about challenges in diversity and inclusion in the scientific community.

Technical Summary

Solid state chemistry focuses on the synthesis, structure, properties, and applications of materials with extended structures.  It contributes to significant advances in fundamental scientific knowledge, through initiatives connected with NSF's ""Big Ideas,"" including Quantum Leap (e.g., quantum and magnetic materials, superconductors), Harnessing the Data Revolution (e.g., high-throughput materials discovery through machine learning), and Mid-scale Research Infrastructure (e.g., in situ and in operando characterization).  It makes broad impacts to confront critical problems in energy, sustainability, and societal needs, including batteries, solar cells, lasers, magnets, light-emitting diodes, hard materials, superconductors, and catalysts.  The fundamental goal of solid state chemistry is to design better materials with greater control and predictability, by developing relationships connecting composition and structure to the properties and function of materials.  At the Solid State Chemistry GRC and GRS, researchers are invited to share their diverse approaches to solve this problem, by proposing new creative synthetic routes, applying more powerful characterization tools, and developing data-driven methods to discover new materials. Different perspectives are offered from scientists at all stages of career in academic, industrial, and national laboratories.  The scope is expanded to new classes of materials, such as topological solids, high-entropy alloys, hybrid materials, and mixed-anion compounds.  To encourage deeper scientific inquiry, the format of both meetings includes ample opportunities for discussion during the oral and poster presentations.  The “no publication” policy fosters open communication and many networking activities provide opportunities to initiate collaborations, promote learning, and maximize use of shared infrastructure.

Using tools in a branch of mathematics, namely topology, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) aims at revealing the 'shape' of data that are otherwise not easily captured by traditional methods. However, the computational complexity of some important data descriptors proposed in TDA is not very well-understood, which is a major obstacle to their wider applications.

Efficient software for the computation will be developed, which is a necessary step for promoting applications. Efforts of the project will help train undergraduate or graduate students by enabling them to cultivate mathematical and algorithmic thinking through the software development process.

Two foci of this project are the following descriptors revolving around persistent homology (a cornerstone of TDA) and its extension zigzag persistence: (i) representatives for topological persistence; (ii) vines and vineyard from updating the standard and zigzag persistence. Novel data structures dedicated to the computation will be devised. From the study, a deeper connection between the mathematical objects and their algorithmic interpretation can be established, which can have further implications on the computational front of TDA.

The rapid degradation in reversible solid oxide cells during electrolysis mode, caused by delamination failure at the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface, is commonly associated with the buildup of oxygen partial pressure. Significant scientific challenges persist in fully comprehending the mechanisms responsible for the reduced degradation observed under reversible modes, especially with a bilayer oxygen electrode configuration. This research aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap by investigating the intricate interactions between mechanical and chemical stresses at the oxygen electrode-electrolyte interface under dynamic operating conditions, utilizing integrated mechano-electro-chemical approaches. The research will attempt to unravel the complex dynamics of crack initiation and propagation within 3D heterogeneous microstructures of oxygen electrodes from advanced full-field X-ray imaging technique. Through rigorous coupling of model and experiment approaches, the contributions of material variations and structural geometry modifications to performance improvements will be delineated. These findings will make a marked impact on the design of new oxygen electrodes and development of protocols for safe operation of reversible solid oxide cells.

These critical processes of mixing and reaction are significantly influenced by unsaturated conditions, where soil and sediment layers contain phases other than water, such as air or gas, within their pores. This project aims to investigate and quantify how flow, transport, and mixing are impacted by unsaturated conditions in subsurface hydrologic systems. Specifically, the project will use new experimental imaging methods in 3D-printed soil structures and novel numerical simulations to visualize and predict how fluids interact and explore how variations in water content and the physical characteristics of the porous matrix influence mixing and reaction outcomes. Collectively, this research will provide a robust scientific foundation for water resource management and advancing water science, ensuring the protection and sustainability of groundwater resources. Moreover, the project will facilitate impactful educational and training opportunities for students across all levels, complemented by public outreach and initiatives to enhance STEM education. 

This project will develop and use novel experimental techniques and mathematical models aimed at understanding the complexities of reactive transport in partially saturated porous media. The research focuses on investigating and quantifying the interrelated phenomena of anomalous transport, mixing, and chemical reaction in unsaturated porous media, combining pore- and Darcy-scale visual laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations. The primary objectives include: 1) Investigating the effects of flow dynamics, medium heterogeneity, and the distribution of fluid phases on solute transport and dispersion using experimental observations in three-dimensional porous media.  2) Utilizing experimental data to assess the role of saturation in promoting reaction hotspots and enhancing mixing processes. 3) Employing pore-scale properties, flow and transport statistics, and reaction rates in reactive transport models to mechanistically describe and predict mixing and reaction. The project results will be relevant for the improved prediction and management of contamination of water resources that rely on the transport and mixing of chemicals to target polluted locations.

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports fundamental research aiming to prevent the formation of cracks during the semiconductor cooling process. The objective of this project is to develop a novel method that integrates machine learning techniques with fundamental principles of mechanics to predict crack formation. This research will enhance production of high-quality semiconductor materials. This project will also make significant contributions to the field of STEM education.

Tribology is the science of friction and wear at the sliding contacts. Research and engineering efforts in tribology address the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying friction and wear and aim to design materials, processes, and devices such that new solutions to technological challenges become available. Advances in tribology help to reduce energy consumption by lowering friction, to prolong the lifetime, and enhance the safety of mechanical systems by reducing wear, and to decrease harmful emissions in applications from vehicles to manufacturing through the reduction of energy use. Tribology also impacts the life of humans and animals that move on earth. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Tribology is a forum to exchange results of cutting-edge research amongst an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers who are at the forefront of addressing fundamental and applied challenges in this field. This award will promote the participation of students and early-career researchers from diverse backgrounds at the GRC. 

This subtitle, “At the Nexus of Science, Engineering, and Sustainability,” reflects the fact that a comprehensive understanding of tribological phenomena requires multidisciplinary knowledge encompassing a range of classical fields in science and engineering; the next significant breakthroughs are likely to be found at the nexus between disciplines. Most tribologists are trained in one of these fields with an emphasis on either science or engineering and then exposed to other fields as they make transitions from schools to real-world situations. Realizing the multidisciplinary and multiscale challenges in tribology, the next significant breakthroughs are likely to be found at the nexus between disciplines. To achieve these breakthroughs, the very diverse tribology community needs to come together to learn and discover together. Therefore, the 2024 GRC on Tribology invites scientists and engineers from all disciplines to discuss and debate the forefront research questions in the field, and to share how these questions are addressed from different angles. The exchange of results and ideas is held in an informal atmosphere, starting from invited talks given by leading scientists and continuing in extended discussions around contributed posters. The scientific discussion of interplays among various mechanisms over different length scales is expected to lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of the interfacial phenomena leading to friction and wear. The 2024 GRC will provide a venue for this discussion and learning.

Abstract

The Rocky Mountain Geobiology Symposium (RMGS) is a geobiology conference focused on early career scientists in the Rocky Mountain region. This annual event has been an invaluable educational and networking resource for geobiologists from over 20 institutions, including academia and industry. We are excited to continue to support the Rocky Mountain geobiology community by hosting a sixth RMGS in April, 2024. We have three primary goals for this next RMGS, all with a focus on early-career geobiologists. First, to continue to build and connect the geobiology network across the Rocky Mountain region, and grow participation from institutions in the middle Rio Grande corridor. Second, to provide an opportunity for early-career geobiologists to showcase their work and receive feedback from their community. Third, to facilitate conversations between academics, industry professionals, and researchers.

The 6th RMGS will be held at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (“New Mexico Tech” or NMT) on April 20th, 2024, and will be free to attend. NMT is a public teaching and research university located in Socorro, NM, a town of approximately 9,000 that is 75 miles south of Albuquerque. It is a tradition for this symposium to be student-organized, and our organizing committee consists of graduate and undergraduate students from New Mexico Tech’s Biology and Earth and Environmental Science Departments. Our primary goals are to continue to build and grow participation from the region, highlight and provide opportunities for early-career geobiologists, and create networking opportunities among academics, industry professionals, and government researchers. In-line with the symposium’s emphasis on early-career scientists, all talks and most posters will be given by students and postdoctoral researchers, with the exception of the keynote speakers. We have invited three keynote speakers from institutions outside of the Rocky Mountain region to present their research with attendees with the goal of showcasing the variety of topics and research opportunities encompassed by the field of geobiology. We anticipate participation from academics and industry professionals, including attendees and presenters from Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) and Sandia National Lab (SNL), and hope to foster new research collaborations as well as graduate school and postdoctoral opportunities.

This solid-state battery technology, with fast charge and cycle lifetime, has been demonstrated using a lithium metal foil as the anode. However, lithium metal foil is a major cost driver and, thus, a commercial barrier. This research focuses on the development of pre-lithiation processes for 3-dimensional scaffolding materials to introduce a lithium source to the high-performance anode at a far cheaper cost than that of lithium metal foil. By removing the cost barrier to this solid-state battery platform, this project will enable the technology to expand the number of vehicle market segments that can electrify. This high-performance technology, combined with the underlying solid-state batteries, will address a $1 billion market for fast-charging electric vehicles that is rapidly growing.

The intellectual merit of this project is to determine the feasibility of using multiple alternative lithium sources in place of thick lithium metal foil in the anode of solid-state batteries.  The research also seeks to develop an understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the lithiation process in the solid-state battery. While high performing, thick lithium metal foil is a challenge to process with roll-to-roll manufacturing. This research and development will focus on methods to include lithium in the anode that are more easily combined with typical manufacturing processes. The team will investigate the fundamental kinetics and thermodynamics of each approach’s lithiation and de-lithiation process during cycling. By identifying alternative lithium sources with comparable kinetics to lithium metal foil, this project will develop a high-performance anode that greatly improves the manufacturability of the solid-state battery cells.

Engineering and enhancing this light-matter interaction are critical for advancing new technologies and even the new field of quantum information science and engineering (QISE). One strategy is to couple exciton, an optically excited electron and hole pair, to a nanoscale cavity and form exciton-polariton (EP), which is a half-material and half-light hybrid that inherits the advantages of both worlds. The photon nature allows us to manipulate the EP via optical engineering, and the exciton nature enables strong interaction. The light-matter interaction can be further enhanced in atomically thin semiconductors and engineered by stacking two of these atomic sheets together and precisely controlling their twist angle, forming a semiconducting moiré superlattice. In this proposal, we will design a systematic way to couple the nano-cavities with the semiconducting moiré superlattice to enhance the light-matter interaction to an unprecedented level, in which the device function can be drastically altered even by a single photon. This level of strong light-matter interaction can be utilized to implement photonic quantum simulations, a way to simulate new materials whose properties arise from complicated interactions between electrons. Strategically aligned with the National Quantum Initiative and Semiconductor Technology Initiative, this proposal will develop new course materials to train students for careers in high-demand, cutting-edge semiconductor, optical science, and QISE fields. Hands-on summer workshops on optics and nanofabrication for K-12 and under-represented minority students will be organized. The results from this proposal will be disseminated to both the scientific community and the general public to raise national awareness of the importance of QISE and semiconductor technology innovations.


This proposal aims to develop a quantum nonlinear optical device platform to understand and engineer light-matter interactions in two-dimensional (2D) materials for analog quantum simulations. The project will accomplish a hybrid device that couples the robust excitons in a semiconducting moiré superlattice to nanophotonic resonators, forming a quasiparticle known as moiré exciton-polariton (EP), a half-material and half-light hybrid. The exciton in the semiconducting moiré superlattices formed by atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can be tailored with even stronger interaction thanks to the electronic and excitonic flatbands. Therefore, the moiré superlattice hosts fascinating correlated insulating electronic states, and the exciton resonances are modified due to the moiré potential confinement. Strong coupling of the moiré excitons with the ultra-small mode-volume nanophotonic resonators and resonator arrays will lead to a unique moiré-EP platform for studying correlated excitonic physics and realizing nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions down to the single-photon level, paving the way to transformative quantum nano-optoelectronics such as analog quantum simulations. The proposed research will also transform the current state of power-efficient optical information processing and quantum optoelectronics. This proposal will develop education components well integrated with the proposed research to train students for the future workforce in semiconductor, optical science, and QISE fields. This proposal will develop learning opportunities on optics and nanofabrication for K-12 and under-represented minority students. The results from this proposal will be disseminated to a wide scientific audience and shared with the general public.

The goal of the 2024 GRC/GRS Nanotechnology for Agriculture and Food Systems is to provide academic and governmental scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students, as well as scientists and engineers from business, and non-governmental organizations with the framework necessary to address complex questions at the interface of agriculture, food, and nanotechnology required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture systems. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders from 12 countries will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural, environmental, and food science. The objectives of this GRC/GRS are: 1) Bring together experts, emerging investigators and stakeholders to discuss nanotechnology advances, directions, and needs in food and agriculture; 2) Identify cutting-edge research and emerging opportunities to address global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural productivity, and 3) Embolden the knowledge that “nano in food & agriculture” represents a single unifying concept, rather than two distinct subfields. With growing agricultural demands on diminishing arable lands, agricultural output and food production will require innovative technologies and a collective voice of scientists, engineers, and stakeholders to address global needs. The impact of nanotechnology within information science, biotechnology, plant science, animal science, crop, and food science/technology, agricultural and biosystems engineering, and environmental science and engineering are envisioned to lead to revolutionary advances in the next 5-15 years for sustainable food production. The successful achievement of this vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize global agricultural and food systems in numerous ways, and this GRC/GRS will help build a diverse community committed to advancing work in the area of nanotechnology for agriculture and food systems, leading to novel ideas and approaches to create a sustainable future. 

Nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating safer, more productive, and sustainable agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only in its second decade, it is anticipated that the “new” applications to participate in this GRC/GRS will come from persons relatively early in their careers. To encourage open communication, each conference member agrees that the presented information is private and not for public use. This collaborative GRC/GRS environment, with an emphasis on sharing previously unpublished information, enables the cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most critical global challenges. The GRC/GRS chairs will actively aim to achieve a high level of diversity distribution that includes gender, rank, professional, geographical, disability, and ethnic diversity. The significant diversity distribution of scientists and engineers will provide a viable cadre of talent to form a strong intellectual infrastructure required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications. Further, it is expected that this GRC/GRS will facilitate long-lasting international collaboration among young and senior professionals. These collaborations are expected to provide opportunities for joint projects that are anticipated to benefit U.S. science and engineering, and society at large. It is expected that this GRC/GRS will have immediate benefits for U.S. researchers who attend, and amplify benefits for domestic and international environmental sustainability efforts that originate from the exchange of ideas and collaborative projects through time.

A technical description of the project:
The proposal requests support for early-career investigators across all possible diversity to participate in the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Image Science following a four-year gap imposed by the pandemic from 2018-2022.  The support to a diverse pool of early-career investigators will ensure long-term sustainability towards building a strong image science community. 
        Intellectual Merit: Imaging systems will usher in the next generation of innovations across a wide range of applications from nanoscale to macro scale. The June 9-14, 2024, GRC conference theme is “Advances in Imaging and Visualization at the Junction of Physics, Engineering, and Data Science.” which is focused on the appropriate acquisition and efficient uses of the massive volume of imaging information now collected in many fields of imaging. Speakers give ~40-minute presentations in a single-track format with ~20 minutes of discussions following each presentation that experts lead in the field. At the center of each presentation is a discussion of the core challenges shared by image scientists and novel techniques for acquiring and displaying information to maximize decision performance. We aim to build Image Science as an independent field of study via detailed interdisciplinary discussions and by fostering the success of a new generation of image scientists. The unique feature of this conference compared with more conventional imaging venues is the bringing together of renowned speakers from disparate application areas, including astronomy, biology, medicine, remote sensing, quantum imaging, optics and photonics displays, and security and defense industries, in a forum that encourages each to describe their most significant challenges and most promising solutions, to foster cross-fertilization between these fields. All speakers are invited based on their field leadership and willingness to debate fundamental issues shared by everyone developing, evaluating, and applying imaging across disciplines.
         Broader Impact: The GRC format in a small remote venue promotes innovative interdisciplinary thinking that leads to breakthroughs. An environment where leading senior scientists debate core issues is valuable to young investigators trying to build prosperous independent careers in imaging in industry and academia. All attendees are invited to present a poster describing their research in poster sessions, a key element of the Gordon Conference format. Dedicated two-hour time slots are planned daily for all participants and presenter to gather around the posters and discuss the work presented. The 2024 Image Science GRC is committed to developing a diverse program and inclusive conference atmosphere through a discussion-focused program, fundraising efforts focused on supporting historically underrepresented participants, and a concerted effort to attract and accept a variety of applicants from diverse backgrounds and institutions. We strive to increase the percentage of women and other underrepresented minorities in STEM. We will host a GRC Power Hour designed to address diversity and inclusion in the scientific workplace by providing a safe environment for informal and meaningful conversations amongst colleagues of all career stages. The program supports the professional growth of all members of our communities by providing an open forum for discussion and mentoring. We have two co-hosts for our Power Hour, an African-American woman and another mid-career scientist woman - both were speakers at our 2022 GRC image science. The plan for the Power Hour is for the hosts to share statistics on diversity (women and minorities) progress in STEM and share remaining challenges. We will form small groups to discuss different issues and share back with the group. Based on the 2022 survey, we plan to acknowledge the underrepresentation of LBGTQ+ people in the sciences and open discussion on how we may evolve as a community to make everyone feel included and supported. The Image Science GRC is complemented by the student-run Image Science Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on June 7-8, 2024.

The low Earth orbit (LEO) environment has been shown to be a unique testbed to discover and develop novel drugs, therapies, and nutraceuticals. As biology adapts to space, changes in physiology can provide scientists with new drug targets and secondary metabolites. In addition, physiological studies conducted on astronauts have generated high-value datasets capable of supporting a variety of aging related initiatives. These studies support the use of the LEO environment for the development of therapies treating cognitive function loss, cardiac health reduction, muscle atrophy, and bone loss. Past results from space-based R&D indicate that by enabling more biotech missions, society stands to benefit from breakthroughs in agriculture, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and biomanufacturing. Space Biobank will become the platform that enables on-orbit discovery and scalable production through reliable access to this unique biological and physical environment.

This SBIR Phase I project will develop a space biobank, the first repository for microbial species produced from and optimized for the space environment. This initiative aims to democratize space-based research by facilitating broader community engagement. Unlike the well-established engineering standards within the space industry, biological standardization for organisms and scientific processes is lacking. The space biobank addresses this gap, enabling teams to streamline pre-flight development, conduct experiments using space-flown strains, and enhance mission comparability. The PI’s company has operated a dozen ISS missions focused on both growth and production through targeted biomanufacturing and bioprospecting/drug discovery missions. The resulting strains and those developed for and on future missions will be made available to the biotech market through the space biobank. A suite of postflight characterizations will determine metabolic and functional modifications observed in the space environment prior to inclusion in the space biobank.

Undergraduate students will use the new observations in the classroom, seventh-grade classrooms will gain hands-on experience with the SPARC, and an open house will be organized to engage the broader public.

These facilities will be used to collect data to test two hypotheses: (1) near-surface lake breeze thermodynamic characteristics immediately adjacent to Lake Michigan are not significantly different from their counterparts over Lake Michigan owing to the short residence time of the lake-influenced airmass over land and (2) horizontal and vertical temperature and density gradients along the leading edge of the lake-breeze circulation have greater magnitudes early in the lake-breeze season than they do during the season’s peak because of the climatologically greater temperature differential between Lake Michigan and adjacent land masses. The proposed research will allow undergraduate atmospheric science majors the opportunity to develop new understanding and generate their own conceptual models of lake-breeze circulations and to apply theories from the classroom to observational research. Further, the project will involve three seventh-grade science classes from Milwaukee Public Schools in hands-on activities with the SPARC. Finally, an open house will facilitate broader public engagement with atmospheric observation and regional weather and climate.

This project will develop a novel small satellite with embedded optical communications systems. It will be equipped with two distinct optical communications terminals, one for long-range connectivity and the second one for short-range, swarm connectivity. The small satellite’s long-range terminal consists of six optical transceivers evenly distributed around the body of the spacecraft to provide omnidirectional coverage. The transceivers will be fully integrated into and commanded by a fast processor. The small satellite will have a coherent modulation architecture operating at around 1550 nanometers. The transmitter design to be pursued during this project includes a distributed feedback laser diode, a phase modulator, an optical amplifier, a circulator, and a collimator. All these components will be connected by optical fibers. The seed laser will produce a 10-milliwatt laser beam, which is passed through the phase modulator where it is modulated at high speeds (10-100 gigabit per second). After the modulator, the modulated beam is boosted via an optical amplifier and passed through a collimator to generate a collimated, high-power beam. The collimator launches the beam into free space and directs it to a steering mirror for coverage of its field of regard.

This planning grant project aims to lay the foundation for a comprehensive research initiative, investigating how the parallel algorithms and High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can efficiently tackle complex optimization problems in power system operations. The successful outcome of this inquiry has the potential to yield billions of dollars in annual savings within the U.S. energy sector through systematic power system optimization.

This research aims to develop new biomaterials and tools to cultivate microorganisms and study them in conditions that closely mimic the environment in which they naturally grow. Current methods rarely do this, so scientists study microbes that can grow and not those present but unable to grow in nonnatural conditions. Therefore, most microorganisms are poorly studied, even if known to exist. This has impeded the scientific discovery of novel materials made by microorganisms that have potential applications in health care, environmental remediation, or industrial use. In this research, microbes isolated from various natural sources will be enclosed in capsules that are smaller than the width of a hair. The composition of capsule will be designed to facilitate the growth of the microbial species enclosed and their communication with the outside environment. This new ‘nanoculture system’ will be used to study how the enclosed microbial communities communicate and interact with ‘outside’ microorganisms a natural environment, like that in the gastrointestinal track. This will be tested by feeding the encapsulated microbes to mice without gut microbes and determining if the nanoculture system can restore gastrointestinal health. The results of this research will result in new capabilities to grow microorganisms and develop new materials from these understudied microbes with potential to restore balance to the gut’s microbiomes. The project will expose high school students to the field of biotechnology and develop their technical skills and seed their professional networks as strategies to inspire future careers in this area.

PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This research aims to harness a microfluidic-based technique to develop a multifunctional nanoculture system as a high-throughput assessment tool for microbial community dynamics. The nanocultures are nanoliter cultures made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes, which can be manipulated for tunable permeability. The mechanical, transport, and magnetic properties of the nanocultures can facilitate the long-term storage and incubation of the microbial communities in environmental conditions. The nanocultures are thus microdevices capable of eliminating growth rate bias associated with interspecies competition and preserving microbes against biological and chemical insults. The soft-shelled microcapsules can harbor, culture, and store a multitude of microbes for purposes including community dynamics study, growth of challenging species, and the delivery of defined communities for microbiome restoration. A technology will be built to sequester and monitor the dynamics of synthetic or defined microbial consortia in environmental conditions. Specifically, a functional housing will be designed to characterize the unintended ecological impacts of the synthetic communities and to investigate the advantages of their controlled delivery in manipulating various microbiomes. The feasibility of the functional nanocultures for delivering a probiotic producing IL-2 in a mouse model of total body irradiation will be determined. The intellectual merit stems from the body of knowledge that the proposed work seeks to generate. Upon completion of the proposed research, we expect to have vertically advanced microbial-based technology by providing an alternative strategy to quickly and reliably assess the persistence, stability, and safe delivery of a synthetic community capable of impacting microbiomes relevant to human health. Finally, the proposed project is a transformative education model that will engage students and faculty from underrepresented groups. It will promote activities to help students develop new technical skills, participate in conferences, craft their professional development plan, and help 9-12 and undergraduate students embrace the STEM career.

This simulation data will be pre-computed for all locations within the Electronic Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power grid, enabling planners and investors to quickly model the probabilistic impact of different renewable energy capacity pathways and different electrification trends. Ultimately, this data will support a more reliable grid and faster energy transition because decision-makers will have access to a single source of future weather data that incorporates extreme events, natural variability, and climate change. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the creation of a climate simulation engine that generates synthetic hourly local weather patterns for many locations and many weather variables (all that are needed to model energy resources such as utility demand, wind generation, and solar generation). The project will not rely on physics-based global climate models due to the computational intensity of those models and the need to model local rather than regional or global weather. Instead, this project will research an innovative combination of statistical simulation with artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging the strengths of each to compensate for the weaknesses of the other. For example, statistical simulation models are precise but do not scale, while AI simulation models can scale almost without limit but are not precise. The project research will investigate a new method to impose precision (via known statistics) on AI pattern generation, yielding a high-fidelity climate model at scale. The expected technical result of the project is the creation of a simulation engine that can simulate 1,000 outcomes of hyperlocal hourly weather over the state of Texas--with accuracy similar to a pure-statistics model benchmark while keeping the cost of cloud computing resources low.

Molecular life science education has made great strides in recent years in the development of evidence-based, student-centered initiatives that engage undergraduates and foster enthusiasm for remaining in STEM-based career trajectories.  This project will enable a group of instructors from traditionally under-resourced institutions, such as community colleges and minority-serving institutions, to become familiar with a series of NSF-supported communities that represent a range of pedagogical initiatives and evidence-based practices in molecular life sciences including case studies, course-based undergraduate research experiences, and biomolecular visualization literacy.  The instructors that participate in the project will be able to bring these pedagogical ideas home to their respective students and colleagues, thereby strengthening the ways in which STEM education is provided at these institutions.  By doing so, this project will help to bring a new set of diverse voices into the national conversation on molecular life science educational best practices and strengthen ongoing efforts to spread these practices to as wide an audience as possible.  The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  This project is also supported by NSF’s RCN:UBE Program, which seeks to develop networks to foster the use of evidence-based practices in undergraduate biology education.

This field is concerns functions with Fourier transform (frequencies) supported (non-zero at most) on some curved objects such as a sphere or a cone. Such functions appear naturally in several areas of science and mathematics: in the study of Schrödinger equations, wave equations and number theory. For instance, a solution to the linear wave equation can be represented as a function with Fourier transform supported on a cone. Investigating these functions allows one to understand how waves evolve in time. In number theory, one can count the number of integer solutions to some Diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by estimating such functions. Namely, if the corresponding functions are concentrated, then one expects the Diophantine equation to have many integer solutions. And an upper bound on the number of solutions can be given in terms of how spread out the functions are. This project will be focused on how the curvature of the Fourier support prevents the functions from being concentrated.

The work will be concentrated on oscillatory integrals and related to Falconer's conjecture. The latter is an unsolved question concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in compact d-dimensional spaces. The projects on oscillatory integrals concern the restriction conjecture, the Hormander operator, and decoupling questions. For the restriction conjecture, Stein's restriction conjecture will be studied in higher dimensions and in dimension three. For the Hörmander operator the Bochner-Riesz conjecture will be investigated by considering it as a Hörmander operator not satisfying Bourgain's ""generic failure"" condition. Work will be done on the dimension of radial projections with applications surrounding Falconer's conjecture.

Stable nanocrystalline alloys are emerging as ideal candidates for such materials. These alloys leverage fundamental concepts in engineering mechanics to provide desirable properties such as resistance against harsh environments. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental engineering research efforts needed to provide the knowledge to understand, develop, and design stable nanocrystalline alloys. Current methods need to be improved in their ability to understand how these materials deform and fail under harsh environments. This work develops advanced computational methods assisted by machine learning to overcome these limitations. As such, this work could revolutionize the aerospace, energy, and defense industries and advance the US economy and society. This multidisciplinary research spans mechanics of materials, manufacturing, computational physics, and machine learning. The multidisciplinary approach will engage students from diverse backgrounds and help train the next generation of the nation’s STEM workforce.

Stable nanocrystalline alloys use solute clusters to stabilize the microstructure under high temperatures and high strain rate loading. Solute clusters pin grain boundaries and prevent defect propagation. While the role of grain boundaries and solute clusters have been studied under quasi-static loading, much work is needed for highly dynamic environments like shock loading. This work develops a novel concurrent atomistic continuum approach to investigate the role of grain boundaries and solute clusters on shock-induced defect generation and spall fracture. A graph neural network-based approach will help develop a microstructurally sensitive reduced-order model to predict continuum-level shock properties. The team will perform extensive validation and verification tests to ensure the validity of the concurrent model and the graph neural network. The PI will integrate education and research through underlying wave propagation, material failure, and machine learning concepts. In partnership with local science museums, the team will develop a unique learning platform, Mechblocks, to provide fun and hands-on education to K-12 students on underlying concepts of the mechanics of materials and structures.

The proposed innovation is a novel AI-based technology integrated into a mobile app that allows the assessment of drug use or alcohol intoxication based on voice signals. Substance and alcohol use disorders are prevalent across every stratum of our society.  Not only are the users impacted, but the penumbra of individuals impacted includes every citizen in the US. Preventing early exposure to illicit drugs and alcohol lowers the likelihood of developing severe addiction later in life. By disrupting normal brain development, various substances increase the long-term negative effects on a child’s life. Given the skyrocketing rates of depression and anxiety among teenagers, the wide availability of highly potent synthetic substances, and the ease of access to drugs, parents feel ill-equipped to protect their children.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will help advance knowledge in several important areas, such as artificial intelligence capabilities, leveraging digital media platforms for data collection, synthetic audio data generation, and using the mix of temporal and spectral domains for audio analysis. Each area is an active research field, but the combination of all these areas into a product for analyzing voice to detect intoxication caused by various substances has not been previously attempted by academia or industry. The company’s technology relies on the unique impact that each substance use has on neuromotor function, as manifested by the bio-mechanical process of voice production. By comparing the voice signal against the speakers’ baseline voice, the technology will flag abnormal deviations of acoustic features that are typically consistent with intoxication. The field of voice analysis integrates a range of features and signal characteristics to extract valuable insights from voice signals. The primary objectives are to develop and deploy this AI-based technology in ubiquitous devices such as mobile phones while ensuring its performance in real-life conditions and achieving soft real-time processing.

The SGT Forum is a grassroots, volunteer-run, community meeting in structural geology and tectonics. Over the past decade, the SGT Forum has provided a venue for investigators and educators to communicate, develop, and advance research and teaching in the discipline. Within the geosciences, the field of Structural Geology and Tectonics covers topics that deal with gaining a better understanding of the history and effects of plate motions, and includes studies of fault zones, earthquakes and seismic hazards, determining the history of past plate motions and their influence on volcanic processes and mountain-building events. The meeting location provides an ideal opportunity to gather interested geoscientists in a setting that has a rich and varied array of active and ancient plate tectonic environments in a region with a large number of geoscientists working together to better understand a large set of structural and tectonic issues. The campus of Western Washington University will be the meeting location, and the meeting will recruit and invite a diverse array of geoscientists to participate and will actively seek participation from local and regional 2-year colleges and other institutions with diverse students and faculty. Early career faculty and graduate students will be strongly encouraged to participate, and we will plan for a rich set of networking and professional development opportunities as part of the meeting. Outcomes that stem from this meeting will include better identification of priorities and advances in structural geology and tectonic problems for the Pacific NW region, improvements in training and professional development of geoscience researchers, and to improve community ties and communication and professional networking among the participating geoscientists and the different institutions they work for. Overall, this will result in better understanding of seismic activity and hazards of the region, and improve our understanding of its history of plate-margin processes, which together will benefit the citizens of the region and the nation at large.


The SGT Forum is a platform for building research connections and informal mentorship. Gathering and soliciting meeting participants from a diverse range of professional experience and background will foster greater engagement and participation in geosciences and structural/tectonic research and activities. Three principal goals of the SGT Forum: 1) To identify priorities and share advances in research findings and techniques particular to problems in structural geology and tectonics, 2) To address training and professional development for researchers at all stages, 3) To facilitate networking and community building. For the meeting in Bellingham, they take advantage of local field opportunities and expertise. The setting also brings a natural connection to large research initiatives, and a chance to broaden engagement. The goal is to connect field trips and workshops to talks, poster sessions, and panel discussions across several themes:
Deformation of mafic and ultramafic rocks. Activities include a field trip to Twin Sisters dunite; StraboMicro demonstration; research presentations highlighting results from field and lab; and open discussion of research priorities.

The ability to use Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to remotely modify, optimize, and enhance the resiliency of Cube Satellites to cyberattacks is crucial to this evolving industry. The solution extends to the high growth commercial space industry-related Earth Observation (EO), and Direct Satellite to Device/Smartphone markets. The development of small satellites has notably increased the interest of private companies and government agencies in investing in this field, as it allows for more affordable access to new business models in space, including satellite constellations. Space applications, ranging from machine to machine (M2M), the Internet of Things, and Earth observation use cases, are expected to reach more than $22 billion in service revenue by 2031. The market is rapidly moving from an infrastructure-heavy investment cycle towards an as-a-service-focused recurring revenue business model.

This SBIR Phase I project will develop the technology needed to accelerate the commercial development of the hybrid space and terrestrial communications architectures, in-space manufacturing, and industrial infrastructure. ML algorithms that can differentiate between anomalies triggered by natural phenomena and cyber-attacks represent a significant advancement. This can be applied at increasingly larger scales, higher-throughputs, and speeds for robust security and acceleration of this sector. Through adaptability and precision, ML can significantly reduce the occurrence of false alarms but also excel at predicting the source of the anomaly and attributing the anomaly to its origin. Applying the ML predictive capabilities enhances early warning systems, fortifies cybersecurity measures, and ensures continuous monitoring in an ever-evolving threat landscape. The project would accelerate the integration of terrestrial telecommunications networks and satellite communications technologies, decrease costs, increase service coverage, and provide added resilience and multi-level security compatibility to the nation’s communication infrastructure. Mimicking the operational capabilities of the human immune system will allow for the long-term and evolving effectiveness of a space platform's cyberattack detection and response capabilities.  This decentralized approach will be able to leverage decentralized autonomous organizations and strategic defense capabilities to accelerate human endeavors in space.

One of the goals of attosecond and strong-field physics is to access fundamental information on electronic motion in its natural time scale and be able to control charge migration in molecules, e.g., to select a specific bond breaking at a molecular site, or to trigger a chemical reaction. The main objective of the project is to develop a new, efficient, and versatile numerical method to support the experimental and theoretical study of the interaction of multi-electron systems with ultra-short and intense laser pulses. This work aims at contributing to the development of attochemistry and ultimately bridge the gap between attosecond physics and biology. In addition, as connecting experimental measurements to real-time meaningful physical observables has shown to be far from simple, new methods will be investigated to track the rapid dynamics of photoelectron emitted from different valence shells in molecules, as well as during tunnel ionization in intense laser fields. 

With attosecond physics becoming among the most thriving fields of science, new theoretical tools are needed to support the exploration of attosecond phenomena in complex systems. ATTOMESA, a new numerical method for ultrafast physics, will be designed to treat various multiphoton processes investigated with current experimental setups, and to study unexplored aspects of driven multielectron attosecond and strong field dynamics in atoms and molecules. The formalism used in ATTOMESA includes electron correlation and exchange, as well as inter-channel coupling. It is based on a hybrid quadrature approach, where a quantum-chemistry description using Gaussian-type orbitals is used in the short-range to mid-range electron-molecule interaction region, while finite-element discretized variable representation functions complement the description at larger electronic radius, resulting in a highly efficient parallel ab initio method able to treat strong field processes in molecules. Consequently, processes such as high-harmonic generation and frustrated tunnel ionization can be handled fully ab initio. In this work, the following physical processes will be treated with ATTOMESA; photoionization time delay near a Cooper minimum and between different valence shells using a new spectroscopic method, estimation of electronic coherence in a biomolecule after sudden photoionization, and finally assessing the role of electron correlation in streaking/attoclock experiments. Finally, Bohmian mechanics will be employed as a useful tool to interpret strong-field phenomena in atoms.

While problems in this area are often simple to state, they can be fiendishly difficult to solve. The subfield of function field number theory aims to obtain insight on these problems by considering a kind of model or parallel universe where numbers behave differently. We consider what happens when we add or multiply numbers as normal but, except, instead of carrying digits, we simply drop the excess. Certainly arithmetic is a little easier with this modified rule, but more surprisingly, some of the most important problems in number theory become easier as well, with even some of the most difficult ones becoming solvable. (Technically, we should work in binary, or any prime base, rather than our usual base 10, for this.) Alternately, we can describe this variant arithmetic as the addition or multiplication of polynomial functions in a single variable. In this setting, we can connect number-theoretic questions to geometry, by viewing the graph of the polynomial as a geometric object. In this award  the PI's research uses geometric tools to solve new problems in this area.

The PI's research has resolved function field analogues of classical problems in number theory, including the twin primes conjecture and Chowla's conjecture (both joint with Shusterman), cases of the Ramanujan conjecture (joint with Templier), and conjectures about moments of L-functions. In this award the PI will continue along these lines, proving additional results about the distribution of prime numbers, L-function moments, and automorphic forms, and work in further directions such as non-abelian Cohen-Lenstra heuristics. These works are all based on etale cohomology theory, where the foundational result, Deligne's Riemann Hypothesis, allows many different analytic problems (problems about proving some inequality) to be reduced to cohomology problems (problems about calculating some of the cohomology groups of a variety or sheaf). The relevant varieties are high-dimensional, and calculating the necessary cohomology groups requires techniques like vanishing cycles theory and the characteristic cycle.

Students and their families will document their views about learning, knowledge, and engineering through photo journals which will be used, along with classroom observations, to identify students' current perceptions of engineering and to develop place-based engineering- focused interventions for the students that connect to the programming and research happening at the tribal and community colleges.
The citizens of rural Montana and the seven tribal reservations within Montana have a great wealth of local funds of knowledge. Children internalize these family and community funds of knowledge and resources to make meaning and define themselves, creating funds of identity that serve as a lens through which they view and absorb new information and new identities. This project explores the connections between funds of identity and engineering identity development and the mediating factors that inform this relationship. The project team engages with teachers to identify methods that can be used to identify elementary students' funds of identity and current perceptions of engineering. This information is then utilized by professional learning community members to develop place-based engineering-focused interventions for students. The research design is a multiple case study with Little Big Horn College (tribal college) and partnering reservation elementary schools as Case A and Gallatin College (community college) and partnering rural schools as Case B. Both quantitative and qualitative data are collected from individual students, teachers, and tribal and community college partners at multiple time points, allowing researchers to examine the intervention across time and contexts. Data are analyzed at the individual, with-in case, and cross-case levels to examine student, teacher, and community level impacts. This exploration of the connections between funds of identity and engineering identity in children will provide valuable insight into how educators can leverage funds of identity to create meaningful learning experiences that allow students to recognize the value of their knowledge and support their engineering identity development.

However, few opportunities exist for students with disabilities to prepare for graduate studies. This undergraduate research experience site will enable new opportunities for students with and without disabilities to be involved in digital accessibility research. The proposed research will bridge the digital divide, ensuring that individuals with diverse abilities can leverage the advancements in technology, leading to a more inclusive and equitable digital society.

The proposed research projects within the site will develop new knowledge, methods, and frameworks to build the next generation of inclusive software and assess the challenges that people with disabilities experience when using technology. This site will build on the experience of many mentors who have worked with undergraduate students in their individual research to cover three themes: (1) Inclusive Software Requirements Engineering and Design, (2) Inclusive Software Development, and (3) Inclusive Software Testing and Maintenance. The proposed activities will include understanding the research literature, formulating and refining relevant research questions, performing empirical studies and designing novel approaches and prototypes. Students engage in critical problem-solving and multidisciplinary research through these projects, which incorporate principles from computer science, software engineering, human-computer interaction, health and related disciplines. Students will be able to broaden their understanding of user-centered design and the significance of developing equitable digital experiences. In addition to conducting research, the students will participate in other professional development activities, such as field trips, professional seminars, invited speaker series, career guidance, and graduate school preparation.

Currently, software containers are emerging technologies that enable easy deployment of the software as services, independent from the hardware devices hosting them in such devices as smart and connected vehicles.  The execution of software containers can become computationally expensive in constrained environments with limited central processing unit (CPU) memory and energy resources. This technology is designed to provide efficient management of these containers, which is key to enabling the on-demand usage of vehicle software applications while considering several constraints and priorities including security.

This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This technology is based on the prior development of software container management technology for constrained environments such as embedded devices/electronic control units (ECUs) in smart cars. The technology is an orchestration solution to manage the performance of software running both on the edge and in the cloud. The technology balances the load between ECUs in the car, minimizing the CPU memory and power consumption when in power saving mode, while also handling the constraints in the car and in other devices such as phones.  The technology is designed to allocate or move or suspend containers between the clusters/ECUs. The solution was evaluated using different real-world scenarios (e.g., bugs isolation and low energy mode), using heterogeneous clusters of ECU devices in the vehicle.

Diatoms float in the surface ocean as part of a group of organisms collectively called phytoplankton. There are thousands of different species of diatoms distributed across the global ocean.  A famous oceanographer Henry Bigelow once said ""All fish is diatoms"" reflecting the importance of diatoms as the base of the food chain that supports the world's largest fisheries. Despite their small size, diatom photosynthesis produces 20% of the oxygen on earth each year. That's more than all of the tropical rainforests on land. The major objective of the research is to understand how the metabolic differences among diatom species affects the amount of diatom organic carbon that is carried, or exported, from the surface ocean to the deep ocean. As diatoms are photosynthesizers like green plants, their biological carbon comes from converting carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater from the atmosphere into organic forms.  Diatoms also require a series of other nurtrients supplied by the ocean such as nitrogen and phosphorous and, uniquely for diatoms, the silicon used to construct their glass shells.  This research will investigate how genetic and physiological differences among diatoms influence how each species react to changes in nutrient levels in the ocean and how those shifts affect the export of diatom carbon to the deep sea. The link between diatoms' physiological response and their carbon export comes about because shifts in physiology affect diatom attributes like how fast they sink and how tasty they are to predators. So if we can relate the physiological condition of different diatoms to the food-web pathways followed by different species, we can ultimately use knowledge of diatom physiological status and food web structure to predict how much diatom carbon gets to the deep sea. The research involves investigators with expertise in the physiology and genomics of diatoms and in the ocean's chemistry. The work will initially take place in the subarctic North Pacific in conjunction with the NASA Export Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field program. The EXPORTS program is using a wide variety of methods to quantify the export and fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the upper ocean. The research supports the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research will also serve as the basis for activities aimed at K-12 and junior high school students. 

The research will broadly impact our understanding of the biology of the biological pump (the transport of photosynthetically fixed organic carbon to the deep sea) by forming a mechanistic basis for predicting the export of diatom carbon. It is hypothesized that the type and degree of diatom physiological stress are vital aspects of ecosystem state that drive export. To test this hypothesis, the genetic composition, rates of nutrient use and growth response of diatom communities will be evaluated and supported with measurements of silicon and iron stress to evaluate stress as a predictor of the path of diatom carbon export. The subarctic N. Pacific ecosystem is characterized as high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) due to low iron (Fe) levels that are primary controllers constraining phytoplankton utilization of other nutrients. It has been a paradigm in low Fe, HNLC systems that diatoms grow at elevated Si:C and Si:N ratios and should be efficiently exported as particles significantly enriched in Si relative to C. However, Fe limitation also alters diatoms species composition and the high Si demand imposed by low Fe can drive HNLC regions to Si limitation or Si/Fe co-limitation. Thus, the degree of Si and/or Fe stress in HNLC waters can all alter diatom taxonomic composition, the elemental composition of diatom cells, and the path cells follow through the food web ultimately altering diatom carbon export.

The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry contribute funds to this award that supports theoretical research, computation, and education to develop more accurate computer modeling of molecules, chemicals, and materials. To do this, the PI will focus on the “glue” that binds one atom to another to form molecules and materials: the exchange-correlation energy. In this research, the PI will develop even more accurate approximations for this “glue” that still permit efficient simulation on computers.
Kohn-Sham density functional theory is widely used in physics, chemistry, and materials science to predict what atoms, molecules, and materials can exist and with what properties. Starting from the first principles of quantum mechanics, this theory constructs the ground-state energy and electron density of a many-electron system from an auxiliary system of non-interacting electrons including the contribution from the ""glue"", facilitating practical computation. The exact exchange-correlation energy must be approximated. Widely predictive approximations should themselves be based upon first principles, and be accurate enough to predict the small energy differences between competing states in complex materials and systems. The strategy of this project is to achieve more accurate but computable general-purpose approximations by incorporating more of the mathematical properties of the exact universal density functional for the exchange-correlation energy, i.e., by satisfying more exact constraints, by fitting to more appropriate systems in which the approximation can be either exact or highly accurate, and by carefully testing and validating the new approximations over a wide range of systems. 
Long-term practical benefits to society could include new medicines, chemicals, materials or devices. This research program educates graduate students and more advanced researchers as developers, validators, and users of density functional and electronic structure theory. It will furthermore engage undergraduates and high-school students in the excitement of scientific discovery. The PI will also work with TUteach students and administrators along with other interested individuals in Temple Physics, to organize an annual High School Physics Day at Temple which would be focused on invited high school physics teachers.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry contribute funds to this award that supports theoretical research, computation, and education to develop more accurate and predictive density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy, while retaining the advantage of relative computational efficiency. These functionals will be designed to satisfy the known exact constraints on the exact functional. 
A smoother and more perfected version of the SCAN (strongly constrained and appropriately normed) meta-generalized gradient approximation will be developed, using as appropriate norms not only the uniform electron gas but also many real atoms. Also, the PI aims to continue developing a generalized Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction to the improved SCAN that should be exact for all one-electron densities without losing accuracy for many-electron densities.   These advanced functionals will be tested on the many systems for which SCAN has succeeded, including liquid water, structural energy differences in solids, artificial molecules, and the high-temperature superconducting materials, and on the few for which it is known to fail, such as some bulk transition metals and alloys, as well as on additional complex or strongly-correlated systems. 
Improvements to long-range van der Waals corrections, and a self-interaction correction to the random phase approximation, will also be made and validated. Understanding what makes a functional predictive should guide the burgeoning effort to develop density functional approximations by machine learning. 
The intellectual merit of the proposal is that many known mathematical properties of the exact functional should make the resulting approximate functionals widely and accurately predictive, at reasonable computational cost, and thus make them useful for many applications, not only for the simpler molecules and materials for which density functionals are already reliable, but also for the more complex or strongly-correlated ones. In particular improved functionals are critically needed for high-throughput searches for new materials with desired properties. The small energy differences between different states can make a complex material easy to switch under human control from one state and functionality to another.

The technology can also support carbon dioxide removal from biogenic sources. Net-negative emissions can be achieved in sectors such as pulp and paper, waste-to-energy, and bioenergy. The molten borate carbon capture technology can be used to decarbonize heavy industry by capturing carbon dioxide at the source. These industries dominate global carbon dioxide emissions emitting over 23 billion tons per year, a greater than $1 trillion market at $50 per ton of carbon dioxide. The advancement of this molten borate carbon capture technology could have the potential to decrease the costs of carbon dioxide capture by solving the efficiency penalty associated with high temperature separations in carbon capture. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project resides in the discovery of a molten borate composition that can reduce the cost and increase the design flexibility of future carbon capture systems.  The addition of other metals and or changes to the mixing ratio are expected to lead to reductions in melting point and the ultimate working temperature of a system where these salts are employed. This research aims to probe this unexplored phase space by synthesizing and testing an array of salt compositions that have modified alkali metal and mixing ratio content compared to the reference. Reductions in molten borate melting point have the potential to mitigate freezing concerns and reduce upper material temperatures, ultimately decreasing the cost, and increasing the potential for widespread adoption of this novel carbon capture technology.

Closely related viruses, however, can have very dissimilar genomes, complicating integration of knowledge acquired from the study of independent viruses, and limiting prediction of the characteristics and potential threats of emerging viruses. Viruses, however, conserve a few structural properties that could help circumvent this problem. Most viruses store their infective genetic material in a protein shell called a capsid. The capsid self-assembles from multiple copies of the same (or similar) proteins, and most capsids display icosahedral symmetry. This architecture optimizes the interaction of proteins and the volume available to store the viral genetic information. This research project hypothesizes that viruses have evolved a limited set of replication strategies to specialize and exploit the reduced number of geometrical templates capable of forming icosahedral capsids. This, in turn, may have constrained the number of three-dimensional configurations adopted by capsid proteins, providing a mechanistic rationale for the existence of viral structural lineages. This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing and comparing hundreds of viruses from multiple different viral families using novel mathematical methods. Confirming this hypothesis will offer a quantitative framework to study viral evolution and open the door to design of generic antiviral strategies targeting viruses in the same structural lineage.

Only ten protein folds have been identified among major capsid proteins of viruses that form icosahedral capsids. These folds define viral lineages that group viruses that can be genetically unrelated and infect hosts from different domains of life. This limited number of folds contrasts with the vast genetic diversity of viruses. The existence of these folds across the virosphere, however, remains unknown. Here, it is hypothesized that there is a direct relationship between the viral replication strategy of each viral lineage, the icosahedral lattice of the capsid, and the fold of capsid proteins. The hypothesis will be tested by developing a database that will include the viral replication, protein fold, and capsid lattice of five hundred viruses that have been reconstructed at high or medium molecular resolution. Voronoi tessellations and protein-protein interaction lattices will be obtained to identify computationally the icosahedral lattice associated to each virus. Additionally, molecular measurements of the reconstructed capsids will be obtained to establish allometric relationships for at least one viral lineage, facilitating the prediction of icosahedral capsid properties from genomic information. The new icosahedral framework will be also extended to obtain new sets of elongated capsids, which represent the second most abundant type of capsid. The methods will be disseminated online for use by viral structure researchers.

Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques are transforming the way products are designed and used at the hobby, prototyping, and industrial scales. These techniques are enabling advances in reducing the amount of material required to manufacture products (‘material economy’) as well as in light-weighting efforts (reducing the carbon footprint of these materials). The ability to personalize products has led to advances in healthcare, while rapid prototyping decreases product time-to-market and allows field-based repairs of critical parts. Continued interdisciplinary innovation in the development, control, and application of polymer-based AM methods is important to ensure the development of new high-precision, high-throughput AM approaches and enable their application to industries from healthcare to robotics and aerospace. The short course will teach attendees the core polymer physics-based principles underlying several key established and emerging AM methods via lectures including interactive elements. Additionally, the short course will feature industry representatives and a panel who will illustrate how the core underlying physics and chemistry principles of AM enable applications with real-world impact. Recruitment and advertising efforts will focus on building a multidisciplinary set of participants, with a special focus on early-career participants from underrepresented backgrounds.

The 'Polymer Physics of Additive Manufacturing' short course will be delivered through the APS Division of Polymer Physics (DPOLY) and will bring together experts in the polymer physics, computational modeling, optics, chemistry, and advanced characterization of additive manufacturing processes. Experts in the interplay between additive manufacturing and biology (both biomaterials and cells) and in modeling the unique mechanics of printed structures will also participate. These experts will lead teaching lectures on the principles underpinning additive manufacturing techniques including thermoplastic extrusion, direct ink writing (DIW) and embedded DIW, bioprinting, and both layer-by-layer and volumetric vat photopolymerization. Specific topics will focus on the role of both experiment and computation and will discuss the roles of heat transfer, polymer rheology and flow, polymer diffusion, and crystallization and entanglements; the relationship between 'ink' microstructure and printability; the roles of optics, photopolymerization, and reaction kinetics; and the unique mechanics that can be achieved in 3D printed structures. The focus of this project on supporting registration and travel for early career attendees is expected to lead to a diverse early-career audience.

However, studies modeling occupant behaviors at the urban scale are still limited while such behavior is becoming a key factor in urban building and system energy modeling and energy policy making. Recent work has revealed that urban big data can enable occupant behavior modeling at the urban scale – however, utilizing existing data sources and modeling methods in building science to model urban scale occupant behaviors has challenges. The challenges for studying occupancy behavior at an urban scale are: (a) urban scale occupant behavior is stochastic and complex in nature; (b) lack of occupant behavior data sets to understand spatial and temporal diversity among all different buildings with different functions and occupant behaviors; and (c) lack of an appropriate modeling approach to integrate social demographical and equity with urban scale occupant movement inside and outside buildings. In addition, climate changes such as more extreme heat or cold events and power outages also affect occupants physiologically and psychologically and thus change their behavior. Modeling human behavior has been studied in other domains such as traffic analysis, epidemiology, communication, disaster management, and marketing. The goal of this workshop is to bridge the data sources and methodology gap between building science and beyond through bringing people from the multiple disciplines of building science, social science, energy policy, communication, civil engineering, transportation, public health, and others. The anticipated impact is significant contribution to foundational knowledge for improving the quality of urban living and reducing energy consumption. 

The goal of urban scale occupant behavior research is to transform urban scale energy modeling and simulation, resilient building design and operation under future climates, and energy policy. The objective of this workshop is to identify the research gaps in existing urban scale occupant behavior research including what the obstacles are and identification of future research directions. The list of topics to discussed at the workshop includes: (1) What are the modeling requirements of occupant behavior at a community level? (2) What data sources have been used in other domains that could potentially enhance modeling capabilities for current building science applications? (3) What are new modeling methods of occupant behavior at a community level? and (4) What are potential future research directions for building design, operation, and policies at a community level, with enhanced data sources and modeling methods from other domains? This workshop will: (a) advance general knowledge of building science, engineering, and modeling through round-table discussions; (b) advance knowledge of methodological development in urban scale occupant behavior research for built environment through panel presentations and intensive technical discussions; (c) provide a collaborative platform for engineers, social science, policy and public health faculty and graduate students to exchange ideas; (d) provide future research directions and encourage enhanced involvement of faculty and students to participate in relevant research; (e) provide insights on better community building design and operation under future climates.

This SBIR Phase I project will synthesize Neural Lyapunov functions, which can be integrated into filter schemes for any type of control system that accepts state feedback from multi-sensor measurements. The primary objective of this study is to enable the inspection and capture of uncooperative, uncontrolled, and unprepared objects. This ability is achieved by fusing data from multiple sensors and applying barrier functions, rooted in Neural Lyapunov theory, to ensure safety within actuation limits and state constraints during the docking and 'combined stack' phases (i.e., when a servicer is docked with a client spacecraft). Furthermore, this technology developed path planning algorithms that use real-time optical measurements to account for the detumbling rates of client satellites, ensuring safer inspection and docking maneuvers. These steps are critical for ensuring safe autonomous operations during the docking phase and combined stack maneuvers. The final outcome of this research is to develop a mission design, analysis, and planning tool to help operators account for different mission scenarios involving in-orbit proximity operations, while analyzing tradeoffs of safety assurance versus fuel optimization.

Equal access to high-speed broadband connectivity is integral to the economic security and competitiveness of the United States. However, widespread disparities in broadband access continue to persist, especially in underserved urban and rural areas. This project will transform the economics and complexity of delivering ultra-high throughput wireless connectivity over large areas. The associated total addressable market is expected to reach $660 million by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 59%. The successful development of the hardware and software solutions in this project will disrupt the telecommunications industry and pave the way for optimal usage of new high-frequency spectrum bands, thereby unlocking the potential of next-generation mobile broadband connectivity.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the current shortcomings of fifth generation (5G) wireless networks that have failed to provide Gigabit-level data rates and sub-millisecond latency across wide areas. This failure is because millimeter-wave 5G networks at frequencies of 28 GHz and higher have very poor propagation range, and building a hyper-dense network of millimeter wave base stations for pervasive coverage is prohibitively expensive. Millimeter wave repeaters are an appealing solution to extend network coverage at a fraction of the cost of deploying new base stations, since they have a simpler software stack and do not require fiber backhaul. However, network operators have a strong aversion to deploying repeaters today since current repeaters have fixed transmission power and beam directions regardless of the actual traffic conditions on the macro network, which increases inter-cell interference and reduces spectral efficiency. The corresponding lack of pervasive millimeter wave 5G coverage exacerbates the digital divide in the U.S. and harms the national and economic security. This SBIR Phase I effort will design and prototype an intelligent 5G repeater that addresses these pain points.

This project encapsulates a multidisciplinary approach rooted in convergence research to address a critical issue in cancer surgery. The primary objective is the development of a bioinspired multispectral imaging sensor, drawing inspiration from the mantis shrimp's remarkable visual system. This innovative sensor, compacted onto a single chip, spans a broad spectrum, enabling simultaneous detection of cancer markers through near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and deep ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence. Our diverse team, comprised of engineers, material scientists, physicians, visual ecologists, and social scientists, unites academia and industry in a collaborative effort to pioneer this groundbreaking technology. The central focus is on real-time intraoperative identification of positive sentinel lymph nodes, a pivotal aspect of cancer surgery, which can significantly impact patient outcomes by reducing the need for additional surgeries and minimizing complications such as lymphedema. 

Our research centers on three primary objectives. Firstly, we aim to develop an advanced multispectral imaging device that seamlessly integrates perovskite nanocrystals and optical metasurfaces with state-of-the-art imaging sensors. This bioinspired sensor will facilitate simultaneous imaging of both endogenous tumor-specific biomarkers in the UV spectrum and exogenous markers in the NIR spectrum; both of which are essential for the accurate identification and staging of lymph nodes during surgical procedures. Secondly, we will conduct comprehensive validation of our bioinspired imaging technology to guarantee its accuracy in detecting positive sentinel lymph nodes, both in vivo and ex vivo. This validation will involve the collection of human data in two distinct clinical settings. Lastly, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the practicality and transformative potential of this technology within the complex landscape of surgical environments. In addition to our scientific pursuits, our project emphasizes a strong commitment to public engagement. Through a collaboration with the Saint Louis Science Center, we intend to educate the broader public on the fascinating realms of bioinspired imaging sensors and nanotechnology, using interactive exhibits to showcase our groundbreaking fluorescence camera. Furthermore, we will extend our collaboration into the realm of medical education, actively integrating bioinspired imaging principles into the curriculum of a new engineering-focused medical school: a partnership between the University of Illinois and the Carle Foundation Hospital. By doing so, we aim to equip the next generation of medical professionals with cutting-edge medical imaging tools and techniques.

In North America, $500 billion worth of steam is made every year for diverse industries:  oil & gas, chemicals, food, medical, utilities, etc. Around 20% of the lost steam contributes to 1.4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas which would be enough to generate electricity for 15 million homes. The key steam system issue comes from failed or underperforming traps that go undetected. A correctly working steam system is a closed loop environment that maintains the required pressure and temperature for proper steam flow. Over time, steam converts to liquid condensation and is captured in traps to be cleared on a regular basis to maintain the steam system performance integrity. In this project, a new trap system is designed to replace the current passive mechanical technology. The system integrates an active electromechanical system and remote monitoring using Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors, providing steam operators with real-time monitoring and real-time data performance to identify steam trap and system issues for immediate resolution.

This SBIR Phase I project identifies the known flaws of current steam trap design and operations by applying innovative solutions to the design a new trap. Current traps are purely mechanical that, when exposed to corrosive, high-pressure and temperature environments with repeated water discharge, wear out for a shortened lifespan. This technology may result into an optimal-performing steam system that continuously monitors steam flow for the best operational performance and reliable water removal. When a trap fails and steam is discharged, energy is lost, requiring boilers to consume added fossil fuels to generate additional replacement steam with unwanted greenhouse gas emissions.  The new steam trap will (1) improve reliability by doubling the trap lifespan from 2-4 years to 10 years, (2) reduce the number of moving parts, (3) incorporate electronic sensors to monitor water condensation levels versus relying on mechanical floats or discs to detect and discharge condensate, and (4) provide real-time monitoring to collect and track unmonitored operational parameters continuously.  This system will retrofit with existing traps for cost-effective operations and to will reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.

However, both ideas require accurate insect surveillance, knowing which insects are where in the field. The cost and difficulty of obtaining such information has meant that biocontrols are not cost effective and are thus rarely used.

This information is important for the precise timing of the proposed interventions. The project’s broader impacts will include reduced labor and material costs for growers, making US agriculture more competitive. Moreover, by reducing the need for harsh pesticides, the project seeks to reduce damage to beneficial pollinators and the environment. 

The project is highly interdisciplinary, spanning wireless sensing, cloud computing, machine learning, robotics, entomology, statistics, agricultural economics and semiochemistry. Progress will initially be measured with direct computational metrics, such as the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor, and the error-rate of the classification algorithms. Intermediate evaluation will measure the insect pest pressure and the reduction in crop loss. The ultimate metrics of success are economic and behavioral: Does the system reduce costs for the grower and are they willing to adopt the new technology.

Extreme weather events often result in the release of toxic chemicals, raw and partially treated sewage, and agricultural wastes into the environment. These disasters disproportionately affect American communities with outdated infrastructure and limited governmental resources. Focused on the Pearl River Watershed in Mississippi and the Santee River Basin in South Carolina, the research employs a modular sensor system, including unpiloted aerial vehicles and low-cost Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometers, to assess contaminant dispersion in watersheds. Through a data-driven and physics-based modeling approach, the project aims to provide reliable spatial and temporal projections for water quality and quantity, supporting decision-makers in monitoring freshwater systems and planning for water emergencies. The interdisciplinary team, combining expertise in social sciences, public policy, hydrologic modeling, distributed sensing, artificial intelligence, and quantum materials, seeks to empower communities to generate and implement sustainable solutions. The project's societal impacts extend to supporting policy decisions, incorporating adaptation solutions, and mitigating environmental impacts from flooding in American communities. The project focuses on developing low-cost, field-deployable NMR sensor systems, integrating data collection methods with hydrologic modeling, and adopting a system of socio-environmental systems approach. This integrated approach is required to overcome challenges in real-time data collection and the transition of academic research into actionable solutions. Low-cost and easy-to-deploy in situ NMR provides optimal sensing technology for developing a contaminant detection, quantification, and tracking system without constraining sensor development to focus on a specific contaminant. Key components of the project’s Phase 1 scope of work include: (a) Refining an open-source compact NMR sensing system developed by the research team for in-situ monitoring of contaminants in aquatic environments. (b) Developing a coupled flood and contaminant modeling and monitoring framework to predict and respond to flooding and flood-borne contaminants with enhanced accuracy and timing. (c) Modeling the complexities and feedback loops inherent in integrated socio-environmental systems using a system of systems approach. The Phase 1 project establishes the groundwork for a potential Phase 2 initiative, aiming for an enhanced understanding of community vulnerability to storm-induced contaminants, advancements in scalable heterogeneous data acquisition for real-time flood and contaminant tracking, and equipping communities with tools to design adaptive, active, and sustainable next-generation infrastructure.

This flow battery technology aims to meet aggressive cost targets for grid-scale storage, positioning the company to take advantage of the domestic and international market demand for energy storage. The battery system provides an opportunity for the U.S. to own high impact battery technology and claim a leadership position in the long duration energy storage market. 

This SBIR Phase I project seeks to lower the materials costs of a metal chelate flow battery for 10+ hour storage durations with greater than 80% round-trip efficiency. The goal is to develop a material purification process that uses low-grade minerals and removes key impurities with minimal waste. This goal will be achieved through the development and construction of a chemical purification system that selectively removes the impurities present in the low-grade minerals. The process will be validated by the demonstration of a flow battery operating with 10+ hours of continuous discharge at full power. The research and development effort focuses on a holistic solution to flow battery performance via a new chemistry that optimizes cost, abundance, safety, and performance in a single platform for long duration energy storage. Areas of development include electrolyte purity, sensitivity to precursors, processes development, system fouling and electrolyte purity sensitivity, purification system design and recycling, and 10-24 hour discharge battery performance demonstration incorporating the new purification process.

However, accurately identifying the composition of gaseous samples typically relies on bulky, expensive and stationary spectroscopic equipment. This Phase I project will introduce a portable chemical gas sensor that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) to provide highly accurate identification of volatiles in real-time. The real-time chemical sensing data will pave the way to standardization in detection and reporting across sectors – a documented challenge leading to poor accountability in emission monitoring, inefficiently timed ventilation and air purification processes, and unnecessary food waste, all of which can have atmospheric, health, and socio-economic impacts. The work will have a significant impact on STEM education, as this highly multidisciplinary project is led by a research team with a strong commitment to outreach, mentorship, and scientific communication. The concepts under investigation range from fluid dynamics, optics, and nanofabrication to AI, building simulations, and methods standardization. This creates many opportunities for research training in different disciplines, allowing students with a wide range of interests and experiences to participate.

The project builds on a relatively simple sensor: a Bragg stack photonic crystal, whose optical reflection spectrum changes upon infiltration by volatiles into its pores. The time-dependence of the spectral shifts is governed by the unique transport dynamics produced by a compound or mixture of compounds and is used to continuously train a machine learning algorithm for classification and physical property prediction of compounds. Unique to this approach, the team introduces and implements olfactory inspired ‘sniffing’ sequences when volatiles are ‘inhaled’ and ‘exhaled’ in specific dynamic patterns that maximize the real-time discriminatory power of the device. Phase 1 research has included 1) prototyping, device miniaturization, and software development for detection of a subset of the target chemicals, 2) device and algorithm optimization for real-time sensing and integration into application-specific domains, guided by a combination of control theory, systems design, and machine learning, and 3) pilot studies in real environments, in partnership with industrial experts. Together, the multidisciplinary theoretical, experimental, and applied team will push the frontier of chemical sensing.

The development of computational methods that accurately describe this coupling is challenging because electrons and protons are so light that they must be treated specially, which is computationally expensive. Professor Hammes-Schiffer is developing methods that describe electrons and protons in a computationally practical manner. She is applying these methods to specific processes of biological and chemical relevance to elucidate the fundamental principles of these processes. In addition, she and her research group are incorporating these computational methods into established quantum chemistry software packages to benefit the general scientific community. Professor Hammes-Schiffer is also maintaining and enhancing a website containing software and educational tools including computer programs, tools, demonstrations, and tutorials. This research facilitates technological and biomedical advances in more effective solar cells and other renewable energy sources as well as improved understanding of enzymes. 

Professor Hammes-Schiffer is developing new theoretical and computational approaches that provide insight into the underlying fundamental principles of photoinduced proton transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions, which play a vital role in a broad range of biological and chemical processes. These approaches are designed to include nuclear quantum effects, such as proton delocalization and zero-point energy, as well as non-Born-Oppenheimer effects, in a computationally practical manner. Hammes-Schiffer is developing these methods within the framework of the nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory (NEO-DFT) approach, which treats key nuclei, such as the transferring proton(s), quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons within the framework of DFT. The multicomponent time-dependent DFT (NEO-TDDFT) approach enables the calculation of excited electronic, proton vibrational, and electron-proton vibronic states. Hammes-Schiffer is developing NEO methods for computing minimum energy paths and tunneling splittings for proton transfer and PCET reactions, as well as mixed electron-proton vibronic excited states for photoinduced reactions. She is also developing real-time NEO-TDDFT methods and other nonadiabatic dynamics methods for the simulation of ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics, targeting applications to photoinduced PCET reactions. She is incorporating these approaches into well-established quantum chemistry software packages and is creating tutorials to explain how to perform NEO calculations and highlight the unique capabilities of this approach. Furthermore, she is maintaining and enhancing a web site on PCET to convey useful information to the community and to provide valuable tools, scripts, and programs relevant to studying PCET.

Bioaerosols directly impact short-term and long-term human, animal, plant, and climate health, viability, and associated economies of scale. Despite their importance, estimates of global mass emissions of bioaerosols have uncertainties of 1-2 orders of magnitude and identifying specific species and their origins in bioaerosols remains difficult. This project involves the development of a convergent, real-world chemical sensing approach to advance understanding of the origins and temporal evolution of bioaerosols, and guide their mitigation, when needed. This project will advance the technology readiness level of sensor technologies targeting bioaerosols and deliver prototypes of a suite of sensors essential for bioaerosol identification. By developing multimodal, field-deployable bioaerosol sensors, this research holds the potential to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, allergens, and antibiotic-resistant genes and organisms. The team will leverage joint projects with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), federally funded research and development centers, including the National Aeronautic Space Agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Boulder), and include strategic translation partners in the US private sector in space, aerospace, and remote sensing. With UCLA on target to become a Hispanic Serving Institution by 2025, this effort develops a highly qualified, diverse workforce, building on a track-record of non-traditional education programs, including the Cal-Bridge and Physics Bridge, creating opportunities for historically underrepresented groups at Cal State campuses, and establishing professional development programming in collaboration with industry, startups, and non-academic stakeholders in atmospheric chemistry, remote sensing, and geosciences.

This multidisciplinary Accelerator team will develop, test, optimize, and combine transistor-based portable biosensors and quantum-enhanced sensors to achieve highly sensitive, high-speed, remote, multiplexed, multimodal, and in situ measurements of bioaerosols, including identifying microorganism species. The team brings together the sensor developers with the sensor end users via engineered prototypes to address a pressing challenge in real-world chemical sensing: bioaerosols. In Phase I, this program will demonstrate a prototype of a suite of sensors: (1) a portable electronic direct-detection sensor capable of quantifying the presence of multiple microorganisms in bioaerosols based on their genetic signatures with a 1000-copy-number or lower limit of detection, (2) an integrated terahertz sensor based on quantum-logic spectroscopy of molecular ions that can perform in-situ detection and identification of bioaerosols in the field, and (3) a dual-comb spectrometer using on-chip frequency combs for bioaerosol identification in the field. These sensors will be supported by the development of a frequency-locked optical whispering evanescent resonator (FLOWER) platform and hyperspectral unmixing and sensor data fusion techniques.

Informed decisions about wetlands management, policy, conservation, and restoration require accurate maps and scientific capacity to consider the role of wetlands in relation to a wide range of concerns such as water quality, wildlife habitat, indigenous First Foods, water storage for drought mitigation or flood control, farm water provisioning, recreation, sediment removal, carbon sequestration, and more. Current maps of wetlands in the United States derive from an earlier generation of science and are limited, often inaccurate, and poorly linked to other kinds of spatial information. This project will integrate advances in wetland science, computing, remote sensing, and geospatial tool development to predict where wetlands are and the services they provide. Our overarching goal is to create a Wetland Toolkit that provides access to state-of-the-art wetlands science; supports proactive conversations about water, water management, and wetlands policy; and provides the integrated information necessary for informed decision-making. In Phase 1 we will 1) gather and synthesize input on priority uses and needs from diverse users of the Wetland Toolkit, 2) identify available data and necessary computing resources, 3) create a prototype, and 4) develop plans for equitable delivery and a sustainable business model. In Phase 2 we will develop and implement the Wetland Toolkit for broad use at a national scale. 

Wetland locations (i.e. maps) form the foundation of the Toolkit, while upper layers characterize ecosystem services, adaptable to different user concerns. The Toolkit will generate a continuous (raster) dataset that can be layered with other continuous spatially explicit data layers at various spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions, such as hydrologic reconstructions of wetlands, carbon stock accounting, habitat characterization, water storage, indigenous First Foods restoration prioritization, conservation and regulatory prioritization, vegetation phenological reconstruction, long-term monitoring, and more. The final toolkit will encompass both analytical information layers (i.e. continuous rasters/pixels), discrete (vectors/polygons), and reporting (pdf and word doc) options and formats that will make it accessible for users ranging from technically skilled researchers to practitioners with limited resources. This project also will draw upon emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and platform designs that incentivize user participation in ways that improve the Toolkit outputs and models over time.

The GRC will also stimulate new advances in batteries for renewable energy storage through interaction of scientists and engineers who are both new and established in this field.

The technical challenges of understanding and improving current electrochemical energy storage systems, which include batteries, require a collaborative effort from researchers in many disciplines. There are still many fundamental gaps in understanding the atomic- and molecular-level processes that determine and govern the function, operation, performance limitations, and failure of battery systems. Fundamental knowledge is critically needed to uncover the underlying principles that control these complex and interrelated processes. With this underpinning knowledge, wholly new concepts in materials design can be developed for producing electrodes, electrolytes, and battery cells that are capable of storing higher energy densities and have long cycle lifetimes, at lower cost. The conference will cover topics related to solid state batteries, next generation batteries, advanced characterization, battery recycling, and policy and techno- economics.

Simultaneously, profit margins in beef and dairy farming are slim, leaving farmers unable to adopt climate-friendly practices that are too costly. This product could increase the profitability of cattle farming while playing a key role in achieving net zero emissions from the food system.

This team develops enzymes to be secreted from a probiotic yeast to eliminate methane emissions from cattle. The company has previously identified a set of enzymes that restrict methane production in the rumen of cattle. This project will further develop and package these enzymes in a probiotic yeast strain which has already been shown to increase milk yield by over 5%, thereby offering a dual benefit to the farmers. Project success requires a) screening an enzyme library to identify lead candidates for reduction of rumen methane, b) optimizing enzymes for further methane reduction, and c) demonstrating enzyme secretion and cost-efficient enzyme delivery by the probiotic yeast. Completion of these objectives will yield a product that will decrease cattle methane emissions by a minimum of 30%, and potentially by up to 98%, while simultaneously improving the health and productivity of cattle.

The conference aims to bring together experts from different communities in which computational models for multiphysics systems are employed. Multiphysics systems model the physical interactions between two or more media, such as couplings of fluid flows, rigid or deformable porous media, and elastic structures. Typical examples are coupling of free fluid and porous media flows, fluid-structure interaction, and fluid-poroelastic structure interaction. Applications of interest include climate modeling, interaction of surface and subsurface hydrological systems, fluid flows through fractured or deformable aquifers or reservoirs, evolution of soil structures, arterial flows, perfusion of living tissues, and organ modeling, such as the heart, lungs, and brain. The work presented at the conference will cover both rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis and applications to cutting-edge problems.

The mathematical models describing the multiphysics systems of interest consist of couplings of complex systems of partial differential equations. Examples include the Stokes/Navier-Stokes equations for free fluid flows, the linear or nonlinear elasticity equations for structure mechanics, the Darcy equations for porous media flows, and the Biot equations for poroelasticity. Physical phenomena occurring in different regions are coupled through kinematic and dynamic interface conditions. The modeling and simulation process involves well-posedness analysis of the mathematical models, design and analysis of stable, accurate, and robust numerical methods, and development of efficient solution strategies. Despite significant progress in recent years, many challenges remain in all three areas. Examples include, on the mathematical modeling side, the nonlinear advection term in the Navier Stokes equations in coupled settings, nonlinear fully-coupled flow-transport models, nonlinear diffusion, mobility, and elastic parameters, and non-isothermal effects; on the numerical side, structure preserving and parameter robust discretization methods, a posteriori error estimation and mesh adaptivity in both space and time, multiscale and reduced order models; on the solution side, stable and higher-order loosely-coupled time splitting methods, domain decomposition methods, and parameter-robust monolithic solvers and preconditioners. The conference will bring together experts in the field who are actively working to address these challenges.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s most authoritative body of climate scientists and policymakers, has declared that billions of tons of carbon dioxide must be removed from the atmosphere annually by 2050 to prevent global temperatures from exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. If successful, this research would provide a path to gigaton-scale carbon removal. The low energy requirements of the process could allow for deployment in locations distant from large energy infrastructure to bring the benefits and jobs of a new carbon removal industry to communities most affected by weather related events.

This project will commercialize a fundamentally new approach to carbon removal. The vast amount of carbon dioxide locked in seawater remains dissolved if it stays near neutral pH, but outgases spontaneously when acidified. This process uses a light-triggered reversible photoacid as a low-energy means to temporarily acidify seawater and drive out carbon dioxide, which can then be stored or used in industry. The proprietary photoacid at the heart of the process changes its structural conformation when exposed to visible light and releases a proton. The resulting increase in acidity upon illumination provides the proton driving force for carbon capture. Sunlight not absorbed by the photoacid can be used to generate electricity with embedded polysilicon solar cells. Two aspects of the system need to be improved for the process to be deployed at scale. The photoacid’s resistance to degradation needs to be increased or a simple and scalable process to recover the degraded photoacid needs to be demonstrated. In addition, the ion exchange membranes used in the initial lab prototype are expensive and need to be replaced with cheaper and higher flux membranes. If successful, these developments would lead to a scalable and affordable carbon removal process.

The aim of the conference is to convene leading international scholars, early career researchers, and PhD students in the fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory, to disseminate the most recent advances. Harmonic analysis is a foundational mathematical subject that touches upon many different areas of study. Since its inception, the subject of harmonic analysis has developed in close connection to the theory of partial differential equations. In recent years, substantial interest has focused on the use of harmonic analysis as a tool to address questions arising in other fields such as geometric measure theory and number theory. The participation of advanced graduate students and early-career U.S. researchers in this event will facilitate the development of new research collaborations and will strengthen the U.S. research community in this active field.

This conference will bring together experts in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and geometric measure theory to highlight and disseminate recent research progress. These three subjects have had a symbiotic relationship for a long time. Existence and uniqueness of solutions to partial differential equations can be understood through mapping properties and regularity of Calderón-Zygmund operators, a classical topic in harmonic analysis. Rectifiability of sets in Euclidean spaces can be studied through the properties of harmonic measure on their boundaries, which connects to key subjects and tools in partial differential equations. The goal of this workshop is to foster progress in all three of these areas by leveraging their inherent interconnectedness and by bringing together a collection of leading researchers to discuss recent advances and to chart the directions for future progress.

The outcomes of the project will reach beyond the societal impact of the E-nose technology by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 workforce development, public engagement with science, and training of industry professionals. It will be particularly impactful in communities where diseases are commonly underdiagnosed.

The proposed work will develop a portable and intelligent E-nose system to detect volatile metabolites (VM) associated with high consequence infectious diseases in animal and human samples (e.g., feces, urine, and saliva). The goal for this technology is to accelerate the ability to rapidly detect specific diseases in both individuals and populations, thereby minimizing the time required for responding to and controlling incipient outbreaks of infectious diseases. During Phase 1, the sensor system will be fabricated and trained to detect infection by avian influenza viruses, followed by the detection of other infections in domestic and wild animals and humans in Phase 2. Diverse sensing data with superior low detection limit will be achieved through defect- and nano-engineering sensing materials. High dimensional sensing data will be collected by individual modulated heating temperature and illumination wavelength and intensity. A machine-learning model will determine the sensitivity value and the profiles for optimum temperature and illumination. Physical and chemical sensor arrays will be integrated with embedded electronics to reduce the overall Size, Weight, Power and Cost profile. Open-source electronic prototyping platforms will be utilized to achieve rapid prototyping and manufacturing with minimum development cost. The advances proposed by this project will redefine technologies that support the data–information–knowledge pathway and accelerate the process of turning basic measurements into actionable intelligence. This device has practical, life-saving applications that complement conventional approaches to disease prevention and management by providing real-time monitoring.

Some examples include shaving cream, blood, and the liquid crystals used in displays (LCD displays) like the one you are probably using right now to read this abstract. On a microscopic scale, the molecules of complex fluids have a special structure, which at a macroscopic scale affects the mechanical response to stress and strain. For instance, the molecules of liquid crystals react to electric fields on a microscopic scale, which on a macroscopic scale changes the polarization of the light passing through the material. Monitors take advantage of this property to allow a certain amount of red, green, or blue light through each pixel. We have barely scratched the surface of what is possible to achieve with complex fluids. Medical researchers hope to exploit the microscopic properties of ferrofluids for magnetic drug targeting, to control with precision the parts of the human body the drug is able to interact with. Materials engineers hope to use complex fluids to assemble nano-structures such as the silicon circuits in CPUs. Mathematical models and computer simulations can be used to describe the dynamics of these fluids. The goal of this research project is to design and analyze new computational algorithms that simulate the behavior of liquid crystals and ferrofluids. The algorithms will be used in simulations which may complement and ultimately replace expensive physical experiments. This research activity may also contribute to our general understanding of pattern formation in complex materials.

Mathematical models for ferrofluids and liquid crystals consist of systems of partial differential equations. Due to the inherent fine scale structure of the fluids under consideration, these partial differential equations are highly nonlinear and coupled. Preserving discrete versions of energy balances, length and other constraints of the solutions of these nonlinear partial differential equations is crucial for obtaining fast and stable numerical schemes that capture realistic scenarios of their dynamics. The aim of this research project is to develop efficient and convergent finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Rosensweig model of ferrohydrodynamics, multi-phase flow models of ferrofluids, and models of liquid crystal flows, that mimic the intrinsic structure of the underlying partial differential equations at the discrete level. The resulting algorithms will be implemented and used for extensive simulations to compare to physical observations.

The technology aims to develop a proof-of-concept, cost-effective technology that destroys PFAS chemicals even at very low levels and converts them to non-toxic. benign products in an ambient environment. Ultimately, the project team aims to provide improved water sustainability and safeguard public health. The project is aligned with the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act by advancing of the health and welfare of the American public. Initial demonstration of these impacts is expected to be felt in the water-scarce and economically fast-growing inland southern California region for both centralized and decentralized water treatment. 

This effort focusses on the development of a highly efficient and cost-effective photochemical treatment system for the destruction of PFAS in drinking water resources. Using a novel tunable deep ultraviolet light (a.k.a. vacuum ultraviolet or VUV), the technology aims to achieve nearly complete destruction of PFAS without generating secondary waste streams or toxic byproducts in drinking water. VUV light is one of the most accessible and efficient water ionization photon sources because it takes advantage of abundant water molecules as photon sensitizers, can be readily generated from common UV lamps, and is easy to control and operate. Tuning this light source in conjunction with other benign chemicals creates a highly reactive environment for efficient destruction of PFAS, converting waterborne PFAS into non-toxic fluoride. The effort will involve combination of chemical kinetics investigation, advanced chemical analysis, and technology scale-up in collaboration with potential customers.

Such a system would circumvent limitations in regions where there is limited basic water infrastructure and water quality monitoring, or frequent shortages or interruptions caused by environmental events or natural disasters, such as drought and hurricanes. Water insecurity and insufficient water quality are detrimental to social and economic growth, especially in regions like Puerto Rico and Colonias near the U.S.-Mexico border. The young population is compelled to migrate away from these areas to seek better living conditions and employment, while the elderly who are unable to leave, are subjected to deteriorating living conditions, which result in poor mental and physical health. A fit-for-purpose water purification system will alleviate some of the water insecurity burden in these regions and in turn, address these resulting issues. 

The few portable membrane-based water purification systems that are commercially available require continuous maintenance, high-pressure, and water preconditioning steps, which limit deployment flexibility and increase cost. This two-phase project aims to develop a portable, membrane-free water purification and monitoring system where no water preconditioning is necessary, and the removal of salts and contaminants is achieved using an electric field. The specific technology employed has the distinct advantage that the rate of water output can be readily scaled to meet demand. The focus of Phase 1 is to determine community needs and demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology. First, by bringing together various stakeholders, the research will evaluate the landscape of water insecurity in impacted regions and identify key variables, needs, and design preferences that will guide the development of a pre-prototype device. Second, a coupled computational and experimental approach will expedite technology development and demonstrate practical feasibility. Third, a recently developed sensing technology amenable to point-of-need applications will be adapted for in-line continuous monitoring of water contaminants identified by stakeholders as being high priority. Lastly, Phase 1 of the proposed project will identify key partnerships for further advancement of technology and its adaptation in the field in Phase 2.

The innovation is a digitized, ultra-low power, uncooled infrared detector. The total addressable market for this proximity sensor is estimated to be ~$4.7 billion in 2023, with a serviceable obtainable market of hundreds of millions for the technology.

State-of-the-art sensors drain battery power continuously regardless of the presence of target signal. The team recently broke the fundamental paradigm of wasting energy in standby mode with the invention of a completely passive sensor microsystem that can detect and discriminate events of interest by exploiting only the energy contained in their specific physical signatures. Remaining challenges for chip-scale hand detection include efficiently harvesting the tiny amount of thermal energy emitted by a hand to trigger a micromechanical photo-switch while achieving a high level of immunity to background temperature changes. A new plasmonically-enhanced, long-wave infrared absorber, a threshold tuning mechanism, and vacuum packaging are developed and expected to lead to the demonstration of a miniaturized prototype capable of reliably detecting a hand at 2-10 cm distance, while consuming less than 1 microamp current in standby mode.

The objective of the conference is to bring together a diverse group of established and early-career researchers to discuss recent advances in, and applications of, analysis on fractals and networks. Major themes of the conference include irregularity in pure and applied mathematics, science, and engineering; analysis of networks; and applications involving fractals and irregular shapes. A clear emphasis will be put on theoretical and numerical methods oriented towards applications in engineering and the sciences. Anticipated impacts include increased activity in joint international research projects, academic visits, funding applications, and workshop activities involving experts from applied and pure mathematics. Additional impact is generated through the involvement of beginning researchers in novel research questions on fractal models in pure and applied mathematics, leading to follow-up activities such as student exchanges and internships at theoretical and applied research institutions. This event, the first in a planned series of conferences dedicated to the topic, will foster a vibrant international research community with a clear focus on the use of fractal models in applied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.

The use of fractal models in scientific and industrial applications is a promising area of research, with significant near-term potential for intellectual advances. Although a considerable body of theoretical knowledge is available, the transfer of that knowledge into applied disciplines remains underdeveloped. Two major types of activities are needed in order to effect such a transfer. First is the design of new theoretical models for observed phenomena, for which traditional (smooth) models either cannot be applied or fail to describe relevant features. Second is the development of tools to harvest these theoretical models for applications. In many cases, the fractal model is neither accessible to numerical methods nor useful to construct prototypes. Instead, one must rely on tractable, non-fractal approximations that capture essential features of the truly fractal model, buttressed by theoretical approximation results (e.g., spectral convergence, approximations by graphs or metric graphs) and suitable numerical methods (new specific domain decompositions and meshes, preconditioning techniques, robust and fast-converging schemes). The goal of this conference is to foster ties between pure and applied research communities in order to advance the aforementioned knowledge transfer.

Plants exhibit a diverse array of breeding strategies, but the genetic changes and environmental conditions that lead to this diversity are poorly known. Pinpointing these genetic mutations and understanding the environmental conditions that favor changes in breeding system are of great interest to both evolutionary biologists and plant breeders. The plant genus Schiedea (carnation family, Caryophyllaceae) is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and is a model to better understand the evolution of breeding strategies in plants. Among the 32 species of Schiedea, some only breed with other individuals of the same species, others only self-fertilize, and others still are transitional between the two. Additionally, different outbreeding species of Schiedea use different pollinators, including a recently discovered moth found only in Hawaii. This project will apply cutting-edge DNA sequencing and analysis methods to reconstruct the genealogy of Scheidea and investigate the evolution of plant breeding strategies within the group. Data from this project will provide new insights into the evolution of plant breeding strategies that could be applied to crop species in the carnation family, including amaranth, rhubarb, quinoa and spinach. The project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. The project will produce educational videos about Hawaiian plants for posting on the internet to inform the public. Researchers will also offer public seminars about Schiedea highlighting their research findings about the group.



The primary aim of this project is to reconstruct the pattern of breeding system evolution in Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae) through an integrated program of field, laboratory, and genomic studies. Nuclear genome sequencing, targeted sequence capture, and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) methods will be used to reconstruct a highly resolved phylogenetic tree of Schiedea, identify sources of phylogenetic conflict, and investigate patterns of introgression among taxa. The phylogenetic hypotheses developed will be used to interpret the evolution of breeding systems including transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy, shifts from biotic to abiotic pollination, and traits associated with pollination biology (including scent and nectar production). Field studies and densely distributed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers generated by GBS will be used to test hypotheses concerning the influence of reproductive systems on gene flow, hybridization, and population genetic structure. Data obtained during this project will be applied directly to land management in Hawaii, including the establishment of wild populations of different Schiedea species.

This time-sensitive RAPID project will identify the opportunities and challenges that arise for parents, teachers, and youth regarding the use of these AI-driven technologies in K-12 education. Specifically, it will identify risks of generative AI in educational settings and explore opportunities for supporting future design and engagement, including supports for teacher training and regulation in educational contexts. Findings will have theoretical and practical relevance for education, child development, technology design, and policy. Results will also support policymakers as they work to establish guidelines and regulations to protect youth’s privacy, safety, and well-being in the context of AI interactions. Ideally, this work will inform how AI might be used to close versus widen existing disparities and learning gaps in youth. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

The study employs a large stratified random sample of parents, teachers, and youth across age, gender, socio-economic status, and geographical location. The probability-based nationally representative sample will be drawn from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel. The survey includes both open and close-ended questions that focus on use, perception, and trust in AI systems. Questions will probe how youth engage with generative AI as well as more traditional forms of AI in education, such as personalized and adaptive learning. An embedded experimental manipulation within the survey will test how participants evaluate AI-powered versus non-AI powered educational platforms with respect to usefulness, expertise, and trust. Qualitative interviews augment the survey findings, relying on remote participation to ensure broad geographic representation in a very short time window. Research materials will be made available as part of an online toolkit, enabling multiple investigators to use them across their studies and pool the data for future analyses through an open science approach.

The Fellow will determine whether the Castle Rock flora should be classified as an actual tropical rainforest or a temperate forest by analyzing the plant lineages present and their reproductive methods. The research will advance scientific knowledge of how flowering plants evolved and forests recovered after the last mass extinction, leading to the emergence of the prominent plant families living today. Understanding the origins of modern rainforests is significant because comparable modern habitats are threatened by extinction due to present-day climate change and human impacts. This project will also broaden participation with the training of the Fellow to implement bilingual science communication and public outreach and mentor high school and undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds.

The research will involve an in-depth study of well-preserved fossil leaves and reproductive remains from Castle Rock to determine the composition of the flora, its biogeographic and structural analogs, and fruit and seed dispersal strategies. The Fellow will analyze fossil leaf architecture and cuticles from extensive existing collections (n=~5000) at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science alongside comprehensive tropical collections at the Field Museum Herbarium to make taxonomic identifications. The distribution of nearest living relatives and extant rainforest reference plot data will be used to better determine what biogeographic region is the modern analog for the Castle Rock forest, i.e., living low-latitude Old World or Neotropical rainforests or warm-temperate rainforests more similar to those in East Asia and eastern North America. The morphology and dispersal types of fossil reproductive structures will be evaluated using CT scans and comparisons to modern rainforests and other fossil forests to assess plant adaptations. Training objectives will involve learning additional skills in angiosperm systematics, cuticle preparation, and reproductive morphology.

The study of infinite groups is a very active area in modern mathematics. A major trend in this area is geometric group theory, which aims at understanding the asymptotic geometry of finitely generated groups. On the other hand, this seemingly geometric approach to infinite groups also has deep connections to the more classical theme of decidability, logic, and algorithmic aspects of group theory, which lie in the intersection of computer science and mathematics. This conference will bring together prominent researchers interested in group theory, but from different sub-fields and viewpoints, some on the geometric side, while others on the algorithmic/computation side, to present their work. The speakers are carefully chosen in order to emphasize connections between different aspects, and to stimulate further collaboration. A wide range of infinite groups of great importance will be discussed during the conference, including cubical groups, hyperbolic groups, automaton groups, automatic groups, Artin groups, Coxeter groups, self-similar groups, non-positively curved groups etc. More information is available on the webpage of the conference at https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/3149.html.

In this mission, motors and generators, or collectively electric machines (EMs), play a pivotal role. Through EMs, over 90% of global electricity is generated, 45% of which is turned into mechanical work. EMs are at the heart of electric vehicles (EVs), wind energy generation, and various industrial processes, propelling these essential applications forward. To push EM performance boundaries, it is crucial to explore the multiphysics design space, which encompasses the interplay of various physical disciplines, such as electrodynamics, heat transfer, and structural mechanics. The multiphysics design space is confined by EM topologies, i.e., arrangements of constituent parts in EMs including steel, copper, magnets, etc. A natural question to ask is: what are the best arrangements of these constituent parts? The proposed research is poised to systematically answer this fundamental question and accelerate the exploration of high-performance and highly sustainable EMs. Parallel to the research, the PI’s education goal is to systematically foster diverse multiphysics designers, including those who are underrepresented. The PI’s education activities will include constructing a website-based learning platform named TENSOR to create an inclusive multiphysics learning hub, implementing a duality and analogy-based multiphysics education technique for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, and offering an open-access new EM design course to the frontier EM workforce.
In the existing design paradigm, new EM topologies are often conceived by designers and the conception relies on their intuition, resulting in sporadically revealing new design space and corresponding performance space. To overcome the limitations of this intuition-based design paradigm, the overarching goal of this CAREER project is to pioneer a new design paradigm — multiphysics synthesis which realizes guided exploration of multiphysics design space for EMs using tensorial analysis. To achieve this goal, three research thrusts are planned. First, primitive EMs, governed by electrodynamics and expressed in hyperdimensional space, will be used as starting points to derive new topologies. Second, the hyperdimensional models of EMs will be embodied in the 3D space for performance evaluation and optimization. Third, the methodologies in the first two thrusts will be generalized to incorporate physics beyond electrodynamics and fulfill multiphysics synthesis. In all three thrusts, tensorial analysis originated from mathematics (geometry) and theoretical physics (relativity theory) will be applied.

However, quantum technology remains in its early stages of development, and requires the support of fundamental research. Such support is highly dependent upon programs such as the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), an NSF-funded network of academic nanofabrication and characterization sites and their partners, which is an essential and enabling component of the emerging research field and industry in quantum engineering. The Workshop on Quantum Engineering Infrastructure II (WQEI 2) has three main goals: (1) to review the outcomes from the first Workshop on Quantum Engineering Infrastructure (WQEI 1), which was held in 2021 with support from the National Science Foundation, and evaluate progress toward its recommendations; (2) to understand how new developments in quantum computing have altered the needs and best practices for quantum fabrication infrastructure; and (3) to provide recommendations for how fabrication facilities in the US can best be utilized to meet the ongoing and emergent needs of quantum engineered systems. Workshop attendees will identify technological trends, significant gaps in our existing technical capabilities, solutions that align the needs of the various stakeholders, as well as the value of shared (open access) and geographically-distributed infrastructure, and how the coordination of that infrastructure advances national capabilities in emerging industries and helps to create opportunities everywhere, i.e., support Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs) and reach the ""Missing Millions"". The outcome of the workshop will be a public-facing outcomes report recommending a path forward.

The Workshop on Quantum Engineering Infrastructure II will bring together the quantum engineering and nanomanufacturing communities to develop short- and long-term solutions for supporting quantum research within the national network of nanofabrication facilities. The workshop presenters and attendees will be academic and industry leaders at the cross-over between quantum engineering and nanofabrication, and the presentations will provide overviews of the various aspects of quantum technology. This information will help to ensure the envisioned future facility infrastructure can best be used to enable ongoing and envisioned future projects. The workshop will have targeted overview talks on specific quantum technology platforms, followed by panels sessions, where the participants will engage in open discussion on progress in developing quantum infrastructure and the outstanding challenges to meet longer-term needs. The workshop outcomes will be compiled into a report that will be broadly distributed, which will enable continued follow-up activities on action items from this focused one-day event. The learning developed in the workshop will benefit both the quantum and nanofabrication communities, as well as the broader national effort on establishing a leadership position in quantum hardware.

Improvements in the sensitivity in the Advanced LIGO detectors made this revolution possible. Planned future upgrades to improve detector sensitivity will require reduced-thermal-noise mirror coatings that are used in the detector optics. These improvements will continue to impact gravitational-wave astronomy for at least 20 years. A planned upgrade called A-sharp aims to reduce the thermal noise from the mirror coatings by at least half. The challenge of developing lower thermal noise coatings requires progress in the understanding of the physics of amorphous oxide materials, which is the core research focus of this collaborative project. The collaboration brings together experts in both experimental and theoretical aspects of this research at Stanford University and the University of Florida. The goal is to create mirror coatings that meet the necessary standards for use in future LIGO detectors. The team will continue to train the next generation of STEM researchers and professionals through their multidisciplinary activities and outreach activities.

Future planned upgrades to LIGO will seek to install mirrors with further improved coatings, in particular with lower Brownian thermal noise (BTN), which is a key noise source limiting detector sensitivity. The baseline design for the potential A-sharp upgrade calls for a coating thermal noise reduced by a factor of at least two with respect to Advanced LIGO + (A+) levels. Synergies between the Stanford-Florida program and the Center for Coatings Research (CCR) have enabled considerable progress under previous support. Having identified, based on characterization via X-ray scattering and atomic structure modeling, the connection between room-temperature mechanical losses and edge- and face-shared polyhedral structural motifs, the team proposed Ti-doped GeO2 as a high refractive-index low-mechanical-loss coating. Subsequent experimental work in the CCR and LIGO Lab supported this identification, leading to the selection of this material for the A+ mirrors. The research conducted under this award builds on these results, with a goal of finding coating solutions with a further factor of two reduction in thermal noise for mirror upgrades and/or an A-sharp system. The group will work iteratively with deposition groups developing amorphous coatings, both refining the atomic structure models with data generated from the materials they deposit, and by providing those groups with guidance for next steps in their synthesis campaigns based on the results from the atomic structure and modeling efforts. While the major portion of our work will remain focused on amorphous coatings, the group will also continue to contribute to crystalline AlGaAs coatings by characterizing optical absorption and developing models for birefringence and observed excess noise above the expected Brownian contribution.

However, the Indigenous languages of the Americas are greatly under-represented in this area of science. Furthermore, most such languages are severely endangered, which amplifies the urgency for research on how these languages are acquired, for the benefit of developmental science and for Indigenous communities working to revitalize their traditional languages. This conference award supports an organized session at the 2024 annual meetings of two major scholarly organizations in linguistics: the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA) and the Linguistic Society of America (LSA). This organized session brings together two groups: (1) researchers focused on the L1 acquisition of the Indigenous languages of the Americas; and (2) practitioners working within language nests, which are early-childhood language revitalization programs that immerse young children in an Indigenous language. Creating a feedback loop between science and practice generates a wide range of broader impacts by strengthening the revitalization programs represented by participants and attendees, creating opportunities for Indigenous language revitalization practitioners to extend their networks and professional community, and broadening participation in STEM by Native Americans.

This organized session redresses existing geographical and typological biases within the existing landscape of L1 acquisition research by increasing the representation of the Indigenous languages of the Americas. In focusing on L1 acquisition, the papers within the session deepen the scientific understanding of specific Indigenous language structures, which have been of central importance to linguistic theory but studied only in adult language. By breaking down silos between acquisition researchers and practitioners, the session expands and enriches the research questions for L1 acquisition studies, better integrates Indigenous perspectives and ways of knowing into language science, and builds a body of more linguistically and culturally appropriate literature for practitioners and their language communities. Through creating positive impacts on language revitalization, the session also contributes to improving health and well-being within Indigenous communities.

Soft skills (e.g., problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, etc.) are as important as hard skills for individual success. However, current soft-skill assessment tools are subjective, inefficient, and inconsistent. This is especially painful for marginalized populations such as minorities and women, who often possess valuable soft skills such as stress management and conflict resolution, but do not have the tools to demonstrate it. The proposed solution will change how people’s lived experiences and the soft skills associated to those experiences are valorized. This technology may open the door to better educational and professional opportunities in the U.S., to increased economic competitiveness (since higher education plays an increasingly critical role in the economic competitiveness of a nation), to advanced health and welfare of the American public (since adults with higher education often live healthier and longer lives, and enjoy better financial situations), and to a more developed and diverse STEM workforce (by focusing on valorizing the social and cultural capital of minoritized students).


This project proposes a digital platform that provides soft-skill credentialing guided by lived experiences. The main innovation behind the proposed solution is a proprietary system that combines Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing to analyze the candidate’s experiences and apply different evidence-based social-emotional assessment frameworks to accredit the soft skills embedded in each experience. This solution may be the first time a proprietary ML technology will be integrated with a large language model to provide soft-skill credentialing upon lived experiences. The main technical challenge is avoiding bias in the assignation of soft-skill credentials. Other technical challenges are: 1) the potential scarcity of training data; 2) the correct definition of credential categories; and 3) the ability to explain the ML models. This project is intended to address these challenges by 1) developing a proof-of-concept prototype of the accreditation model; 2) conducting a preliminary analysis of its fairness when assessing marginalized groups; 3) reformulating the accreditation algorithm in case any bias is detected; and 4) evaluating, with real datasets, the performance of the credential classifier, the bias mitigation strategies, and the explanations generated for each assessment.

The conference draws upon the topic of a culture of care. A focus on care reorients the research enterprise towards recognizing how institutions are made of systems and structures, as well as individuals. The goal is to find ways to enhance practices and processes that will facilitate the research opportunities of underrepresented researchers and ensure the U.S. remains competitive and agile in the face of global challenges.  

This conference is a partnership between a national professional society, the American Association of Geographers (AAG), an Emerging Research Institution, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, (UCCS) and a research enterprise organization, the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP). Together, these organizations are well-positioned to catalyze scalable practices into diverse institutional and organizational contexts, especially at minority-serving and emerging research institutions. The conference will include three groups of participants: research enterprise professionals, leaders in institutions of higher education, and early career faculty. Participants will be placed in groups of 3 (or triads) with a member from each of the three groups. The triads will: 1) explore the lived experiences of researchers in navigating or supporting the research enterprise, and 2) recommend practices that are expected to broaden and strengthen the research enterprise workforce. The goal of the convening is to enable practitioners in the research enterprise field to encompass both knowledge discovery and critical reflection on the ethical, political, economic, and emotional aspects of research practice and knowledge production. Ultimately, the conference will offer opportunities to stretch horizons and expand the capacity of the research enterprise to enhance and improve science.

Current state-of-the-art quantum computers complete complex computations at unprecedented speeds; however, they require very low operating temperatures, limiting their practical use. Further, the current lack of a well-established tunneling junction capable of processing phononic quantum information limits progress in phononic quantum computing. Bistable structures are a promising approach for the realization of a mechanical tunneling junction because, at the nanoscale, their energy barrier approaches the energy of a single phonon. This award supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge regarding the nonlinear dynamics of classical and quantum mechanical bistable structures needed for the development of these novel tunneling junctions. These tunneling junctions will be used for processing and computing of quantum information carried by single phonons and will dramatically advance the technology of room-temperature quantum computing. This capability will advance knowledge in dynamics, quantum physics, nanoscience, and nanofabrication. This research will benefit U.S. society due to the critical need for high performance computing in science, defense and industry. This multi-disciplinary research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering and positively impact STEM education.

The objective of this research is to investigate the fundamental nonlinear dynamics and wave transmission through mechanical bistable structures in classical and quantum regimes for their potential application as mechanical tunneling junctions. Such mechanical tunneling junctions will process quantum bits, which is critical to quantum computing platforms using phonons. The central hypothesis of this research is that a nanoscale bistable structure can transmit mechanical waves (phonons) with a high enough transmission efficiency to act as a quantum tunneling junction if the structure is driven by nonlinear and contactless conservative interactions. This hypothesis will be tested in both classical and quantum regimes by 1) characterizing the snap-though dynamics and wave transmission of macroscale bistable elements with contact interactions and nonlinear conservative (contactless) interactions, 2) evaluating the mechanical wave (phonon) transmission efficiency through a micro-scale structure theoretically and experimentally, and 3) demonstrating the quantum dynamics of phonon tunneling through mechanical tunneling junction.

The Northern Hemisphere was largely ice-free 4 myr ago followed by an acceleration of global temperature decline at ~3.6 myr ago, with continental ice sheets developing on northern hemisphere continents by ~2.7 myr ago. Limited atmospheric CO2 records suggest a decline in CO2 from ~400 to ~300 parts per million by volume (ppmv) during that time period could have cooled the Earth sufficiently to enable ice sheets to grow. Yet the cause for this decline in CO2 remains unknown. This international research and educational collaboration between 7 U.S. and 3 Chinese institutions will evaluate a new hypothesis: atmospheric dust derived from Central Asian deserts fertilized the North Pacific ocean, stimulating algal productivity, which in turn drew down atmospheric CO2 leading to Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG). Through field work studies in China, laboratory analyses of ocean and terrestrial sedimentary deposits, and atmospheric and ocean modeling studies, the investigators and students will generate and compare a wide range of paleoclimate records from diverse geological archives to evaluate the role of atmospheric dust in CO2 decline and global cooling at the onset of NHG.  The findings from this research project may ultimately contribute to knowledge with global policy implications.

By evaluating the significance of atmospheric dust in sustaining cool climate conditions on Earth, this study is expected to elucidate the mechanisms of climate cooling in the recent geologic past. Specifically this study will establish records of: 1) the aridification history of Central Asia, northern Tibet, and the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) as related to records of deformation and surface uplift in high Asia within and to the west of these regions, 2) wind erosion of Central Asia basins and dust accumulation in the CLP, 3) dust flux, algal productivity, and sea surface temperature in the North Pacific and South Atlantic, and 4) terrestrial CO2 in the interval of 4.5-2.5 Ma. Modeling and sensitivity studies will (1) evaluate the sensitivity of Asian climate and the dust cycle to the growth of topography and to the background global climate; (2) determine the amount of cooling that could result from Pliocene dust transport to the North Pacific; (3) evaluate the potential influence of Asian dust on atmospheric CO2. Through this research program, US graduate students will gain access to research facilities as well as field localities in China that would otherwise be inaccessible and engage in mutually beneficial collaborative research activities with Chinese partners via bilateral visits; US undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to participate in summer schools, workshops, and research projects; the investigators will develop outreach tools for museums to increase public understanding of the role of atmospheric dust in climate change."

Solid-state high harmonic generation spectroscopy (sHHG) is an emerging technique for studying electronic and structural properties of materials which uses ultrafast lasers to excite electrons and optical spectroscopy to probe them, thus providing an all-optical avenue to gleaning detailed electronic information on materials at extreme pressure. This NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4 research project combines high-pressure expertise from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) with world-leading ultrafast spectroscopy capabilities at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) to deliver a method to measure electronic band structures of materials at extreme pressures directly. The resulting new methodology will provide researchers with a means to directly measure properties materials at high pressure which are currently inferred from accompanying computation, and the project will also expose UNLV students to cutting-edge techniques at a world-leading institution.

This NSF EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 Research Fellows (RII Track-4) project provides a fellowship to a Research Assistant Professor at UNLV at a critical juncture of their academic career, and support for a graduate student to participate in first-of-their-kind experiments. The focus of this project is the application of solid-state high harmonic generation spectroscopy to materials at extreme high pressures in a diamond anvil cell. The results can be used to construct their electronic band structures — information which is not possible to garner using currently available experimental methodologies. A development of this kind will thus fill a longstanding gap in high-pressure research, and the PI and the host will be poised to apply their new technique to a range of problems, which involve tracking pressure-induced electronic phase transitions and chemical reactions in situ at high pressures. The PI and students will have access to unique and world-leading facilities at the host institution and will aid in further developing those facilities for compatibility with high-pressure experiments. The fellowship will foster a strong tie between UCB and UNLV, a Minority-Serving Institution, Title III Asian American and Native American, Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, and a Title V Hispanic-Serving Institution. This will prove transformative to the career of the junior PI, and to the research infrastructure at UNLV owing to the new expertise which will be made present on its campus.

Understanding these changes requires an experimental approach capable of observing nanoparticle-bound proteins with high structural resolution, a technological challenge due to sample heterogeneity and broad, overlapping spectral features. Dr. Buchanan and her students will combine two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and isotopic labeling to provide insight into both the structure and dynamics of protein-nanomaterial interactions. Together, these techniques allow structural changes to be localized to individual residues within proteins. Discoveries made through this investigation are expected to improve understanding of the effects of nanoparticle exposure on biological systems and facilitate the design of bio-nano conjugated materials for applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Both graduate and undergraduate students actively participate in this biophysical chemistry research using advanced spectroscopic techniques. Dr. Buchanan also oversees “Young Scientist”, a research journal for high school students.
 
Under this award, the role of nanoparticle composition, size, and composition on the secondary structure of peptides and proteins is being studied using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. To achieve this level of resolution, site-specific vibrational probes are also being employed. In so doing, spectral congestion will be reduced so that questions related to how inhibition or acceleration of peptide self-assembly by nanoparticles affects the structural organization and thermodynamic stability of the aggregates can be explored. Dr. Buchanan and her group will determine how nanoparticles alter aggregation pathways, with particular focus on determining whether new intermediate species or structural polymorphs are formed. Methods that facilitate better understanding of protein-nanoparticle interactions could be broadly applied in the future to better explain self-assembly of both biological and synthetic polymers into hierarchical structures.

The central focus of the conference will be ten lectures to be given by Professor Jack Lutz of Iowa State University.  Algorithmic fractal dimensions were first developed at the beginning of this century as measures of the density of information in various mathematical objects.  As the name suggests, they are versions of classical fractal dimensions that have the theory of computing embedded in their definitions.  They have already had applications in computability theory, computational complexity, information theory, and number theory.  Most strikingly, algorithmic fractal dimensions are being used with increasing frequency to prove new theorems--some answering long-standing open problems--in classical fractal geometry, theorems whose statements do not involve computability or related aspects of mathematical logic.  The conference will thus be of interest to participants from multiple research communities.  Invitations to the conference will reflect this breadth and will prioritize early-career researchers, members of historically underrepresented groups, and a range of institutions in the Midwest.

The conference lectures will begin with an introduction to the classical Hausdorff and packing dimensions and an overview of the lectures to come.  Following that will be a discussion of what it means to effectivize a mathematical concept.  The lectures will then proceed to use effectivization to define algorithmic versions of classical Hausdorff and packing dimensions.  Application of these dimensions will be discussed, along with how they unify Hausdorff dimension with the later information theories of Shannon and Kolmogorov.  The use of algorithmic dimensions to develop useful notions of the dimensions of individual points in Euclidean space will be emphasized, as it leads to the Point-to-Set Principle that has enabled several surprising applications in geometric measure theory.  The lectures will also discuss applications in computational complexity, information theory, and the theory of Borel normal numbers.  Beyond the lectures, the conference will provide ample time for open problem sessions and other discussions.

By analyzing these variations, an attacker can obtain additional information and use it to deduce the victim’s secrets. As proven by Spectre and Meltdown, these side channel attacks pose a severe threat to the security of nearly all computing devices. Given that side channel protection often requires hardware redesign, something must be done in the interim to secure existing software on currently deployed hardware.  This project studies transformations on existing software in an attempt to harden it against side channel attacks. 

The project consists of three main tasks. In Task 1, the project will attempt to reverse engineer various hardware structures in the processor so as to determine where attacks might occur. Next, in Task 2, the project will use the data from Task 1 to design transformations that will protect leaky software against side channels. Finally, Task 3 will develop methods to confirm that the outputs of Task 2 are indeed side channel free. While typical analysis of side channel leakage requires manual effort, Task 3 aims to develop automated tools for leakage detection, avoiding the need for manual analysis.

Hardware is the ultimate root of trust, the correctness of which is the foundation to the security of all software. However, unlike software, hardware security has received much less attention, from both academic and industry. Until new and secure hardware becomes available, the proposed project aims to protect existing software deployed on leaky hardware. While the project cannot hope to eliminate all leakage, it does aim to harden existing software, making leakage harder to exploit. Tools and methodologies developed by this project will be used to design safer hardware, as well as help mitigate leakage in existing software. 

The project will retain all data, simulators, and code produced in a central GIT repository which will be publicly available at github.com.

In this unconventional computing approach, artificial spins organized in a graph dynamically interact, propelling the system toward rapid convergence to the minimum energy state – a representation of the optimal solution. The Ising computer, leveraging such convergence behavior, exhibits exponential acceleration compared to classical counterparts, particularly excelling in solving intricate optimization problems across diverse sectors such as logistics, manufacturing, supply chain management, drug discovery, and financial portfolio optimization. Despite ongoing efforts to develop Ising computers using classical and emerging technologies, none have effectively addressed critical challenges related to scalability, reconfigurability, and connectivity – essential factors for realizing practical Ising computing solutions. This project aims to tackle these challenges by constructing mixed-signal and digital application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators.  The project will integrate research and education by introducing new undergraduate and graduate level courses at the university, by providing opportunity to work on hands-on projects on integrated circuit design, thus addressing a much-needed national workforce development for the Semiconductor Industry as, e.g., articulated in the recent Chips and Science Act.

The specific approaches of the project are categorized into three key areas. Firstly, the initial approach aims to tackle scalability challenges by implementing many physical spins with fewer local spin interactions. This involves integrating compact latch circuits in a mixed-signal Ising computer, providing a large-scale Ising computer without the need for off-chip random number generators, which is a crucial feature for addressing large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Beyond the scalability, the approach also aims to substantially reduce computing latency by leveraging massive parallelism through continuous-time operation. The second approach will implement a flexible digital Ising computer to address the issue of hardware overhead, which comes from mapping complex problems to the Ising computer with simpler interconnects in a regular grid topology, such as a lattice graph. The flexible Ising computer aims to amalgamate spatial and temporal (spatio-temporal) spin connectivity to achieve maximum reconfigurability, thereby minimizing hardware overhead. The resulting Ising computer with flexible spatio-temporal interactions between spins is anticipated to significantly reduce the required number of physical spins and enhance accuracy. Lastly, this project aims to implement an in-memory Ising computer with all-to-all spin interconnects to address connectivity challenges by embedding spins in the memory array, interconnected via a massive network of switches. This approach is designed to enhance connectivity and streamline spin interactions, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Ising computer.

These issues can be addressed by transitioning computing architecture from a traditional cloud-centric mindset to a thing-centric (data-centric) perspective. However, nearly 90% of the data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) is not analyzed using the conventional mechanism, due to limited computing ability and constraints in power and area. Hence, resource-limited IoTs should be developed optimally to enhance overall performance and extend lifetime. Our objective in this project is to transition from the conventional paradigm to a Sense-Decide-Action mechanism, which can analyze data locally, autonomously, and sustainably instead of sending it to the cloud, thereby reducing the amount of communication via a new cross-layer co-design approach. The broader impact and significance of our project lie in systematically paving the way for innovative foundational computing schemes. These strategies enable efficient instant computing and the necessary design approaches for real-time processing and decision-making systems. This progress brings us closer to the reality of accommodating over a trillion interconnected devices and improving the data privacy of resource-limited IoTs for critical applications, including healthcare monitoring, automotive applications, and industrial sensing.     

The technical approach of this research revolves around the development of low-overhead strategies to accelerate edge intelligence sensory nodes' autonomous operation within an environment. This is achieved by (1) designing and analyzing non-von-Neumann architectures, co-integrating conversion and processing capabilities in conjunction with an unconventional number system to alleviate the existing data movement issue between off/on-chip and processor; and (2) implementing processing units for both generic computations and domain-specific and emerging applications. This automated process of architecture engineering creates search space, defines design strategy, and identifies the optimal architecture to improve metrics such as lifetime energy reduction and overall performance. We evaluate the functionalities and performance of the proposed Thrusts through extensive modeling and simulations, beginning from circuit-level design and progressing upwards. This research effectively establishes novel lightweight heterogeneous edge intelligence capable of autonomously processing various data and compute-intensive tasks in an energy-scarce environment, marking a significant step towards the efficient future of IoT applications.

To accomplish this Nature has evolved to incorporate catalyst sites within enzyme pockets or by physical separation using membranes. The successful construction of artificial analogues of such frameworks would reduce catalyst deactivation and eliminate undesirable side reactions. These are important goals in catalysis with many potential practical applications. With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Moteki of the University of Missouri Kansas City is developing synthetic materials possessing multiple types of incompatible catalyst sites where the sites are spatially isolated. Together with Dr. Palencia of the University of Nebraska Kearney, the catalytic efficiency and reaction scope of these catalysts are being tested. Drs. Moteki and Palencia are actively recruiting students from local high schools and community colleges, targeting underrepresented minority students, and providing them with early research experience. The research experience will increasing retention, and enhancement of underserved populations in STEM field. Summer workshops for community and small college faculty are also being conducted. Such efforts are crucial in forming new generations of young research scientists.

Tandem-catalyzed reactions have been widely recognized as one of the most efficient atom economical and environmentally friendly processes, due to minimization of waste generation. In particular, orthogonal tandem catalysis, which features two or more distinct catalysts with differing mechanisms, offers potential for higher process efficiency. Over the past few decades only a handful of successful examples have been reported primarily due to the difficulty in creating compartmented macro-structures that spatially separate incompatible catalysts. This proposal aims at building a multi-component catalytic dendrimer complex via chiral self-discrimination, which enables the in situ quantitative assembly of various multi-domain dendrimers through metal-chiral ligand interactions. This allows tuning of the microenvironment far easier than conventional covalently assembled systems, making it a more attractive system for reaction screening targeting various multi-step tandem chemical transformations. Our research team aims to understand the underlying catalyst structure-function relationship of the dual catalytic dendrimer by varying polarity as well as architectural design of each catalytic domains. In addition, the efficiency and versatility of dual catalytic dendrimers will be investigated, by using three different types of tandem reactions as models; i) substrate-selective tandem catalysis, ii) tandem reaction involving a catalytically reversible step, and iii) tandem reaction involving competitive catalytic pathways. The operational simplicity in reaction screening and the dendron preparation synthetic steps is ideal for training the next generation of synthetic chemists. Dr. Moteki and Dr. Palencia are actively engaged in outreach activity, they will host an annual workshop as means of recruiting of underserved minority students from local high schools and community colleges for summer research internship in their research groups.

There are two typical stages: 1) finding the general structure of representations of a given group (e.g., classifying irreducible representations), and 2) applying this to representations of particular interest (e.g., functions on a homogeneous space). This project aims to study higher representation theory, which studies the realization of groups as categorical symmetries. The emphasis of the proposal focuses on loop groups, where the theory remarkably mirrors classical harmonic analysis for p-adic groups. In particular, one finds Langlands-style decompositions here. This project focuses on understanding some key categories of interest in this framework. The investigator will study 3d mirror symmetry conjectures, representations of affine Lie algebras, and moduli spaces of bundles arising in the global geometric Langlands program. This project provides training opportunities for graduate students.

In more detail, 3d mirror symmetry, representations of (reductive) affine Lie algebras, and the geometric Langlands program are the three primary ways actions of loop groups of reductive groups on categories arise. A large class of 3d mirror symmetry conjectures concerns the categorical Plancherel formula for loop group actions on categories of sheaves on loop spaces of particular varieties with group actions. The PI will establish first cases of 3d mirror symmetry and apply the results to give coherent descriptions of some categories of primary interest in geometric representation theory. Representations of Lie algebras concern the action of a group on its category of Lie algebra representations.  The PI will extend previous work on critical level localization theory and develop a substitute for Soergel modules that will apply to poorly understood categories in the local geometric Langlands program. The applications to global geometric Langlands concern actions of loop groups of reductive groups on moduli spaces of a global nature, namely bundles with a level structure. The PI will extend the Satake theorem and apply the result to study Eisenstein series in the global geometric Langlands program.

Real-time and crowd-sourced road information, such as black ice, pothole, and road roughness, can improve vehicle performance. Existing road information discovery approaches are not always practically viable, due to limitations in road coverage and lack of robustness. This award supports development of a novel collaborative road information crowdsourcing methodology using connected vehicles. The new methodology will enable efficient, robust, and broad-coverage road information discovery by utilizing connected vehicles as mobile sensors while preserving privacy of the participating vehicles. The crowd-sourced information can be incorporated in vehicle controls to improve safety, efficiency, and comfort. In addition, the new up-to-date road condition information will help address the nation’s urgent need to rebuild and modernize road infrastructure, by informing the road maintenance and repair plans. This research involves several disciplines including vehicle dynamics, optimal estimation, iterative learning control, and privacy. The multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.

The privacy-preserved collaborative estimation using connected vehicles is expected to make vehicle-based road information discovery practically and economically viable. This project will support work to overcome several scientific challenges that need to be overcome to realize full application potential of such connected systems. The research team will develop jump-diffusion process-based estimation to enhance road information discovery performance when dealing with abrupt input/disturbance changes in a single vehicle setting. The team will also develop iterative learning-based collaborative estimation across heterogeneous vehicles to enable the exploitation of local estimation from a network of heterogeneous agents to iteratively improve the performance of road information discovery. Finally, the research group will design dynamics-enabled privacy preservation schemes to protect vehicle privacy without affecting computation fidelity or incurring large computation/communication overhead, and evaluate the methodology in the application of collaborative road profile estimation.
